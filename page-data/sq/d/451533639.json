Overtime the founder of Web Civics and an array of others who've been involved since that time, have participated in the development of projects relating to technologies, some of which have become instrumentally important worldwide.  The specific concept of Human Centric AI first started some years ago.  Sometime later, the Facebook Group [Human Centric AI](https://www.facebook.com/groups/humancentric.ai.tech) was set-up although not enough has been done with it since. \n\nThe term 'Human Centric AI' has proliferated over recent years, and is often used in connection to various different sorts of considerations and fields of interest; and in-turn also, sought to be applied to different types of systems that present different types of characteristics. As the consequences of AI is becoming far more apparent, it appeared to me that it would be good to have some sort of community engagement structure that could help foster the growth of Human Centric AI considerations - for the betterment of humanity.\n\nThis Documentation site is intended to provide information relating to the topic and perhaps also, any particular projects that might be done by the group.  \n\n### Community Channels\n\n- [Human Centric AI Discord Group](https://discord.gg/aRTzYX9QY4)\n - [Human Centric AI Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/humancentric.ai.tech)\n- [Human Centric AI LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14154710/)\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/","title":"dev-ops"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# dev-ops\nThis folder contains notes.\n\n`/WIP/` Contains info on the Work In Progress (where things are upto, etc.)\n\n`/SocialFactors` is about the considerations - philophical design stuff, etc.\n\n`/app` is about the app dev stuff, tech / geek.\n\n## Basic structure\n\n### popup.html \n\n### sidebar.html\n\n### overlay.html\n\n\n\n### index.html and related pages\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/","title":"Old Notes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Old Notes\nThis folder contains notes from documentation relating to other related projects, that will in the end become part of this project.\n\nThe Founder of this site is also undertaking an array of works that relate to this field, but are presently defined as being independent.  In particular, this includes the works on the [Webizen AI Ecosystem](https://devdocs.webizen.org/) which incorporates works to produce what has been called [Permissive Commons](https://devdocs.webizen.org/PermissiveCommons/).  As the Webizen AI systems are unlicensed at this stage, the development of this [[HumanCentricAI]] web civics initiative seemed like a usefully positive idea.\n\nThere are a few shared objectives that exist, and have therefore been added to the projects folder.  \n\nThe First is a project that was started now sometime ago; that was simply seeking to create some materials to support communicators who are looking to talk about [[ArtificialMinds]] and in-turn support considerations and deliberations about what it is the group seeks to achieve.\n\nThe Second, is an initiative to look at [[AgentLabelling]] with a view to seeking to produce a set of methods, specifications and marks that support the means for willing operators to support the idea of seeking to ensure that observers / consumers / users, are able to be made aware of when and how AI is playing some sort of role in their observations and/or experiences; both online and offline. \n\nThe Third is a project that's led by a W3C CG to produce an open-standard for [[CognitiveAI]]. \n\nThe Fourth is about the production of Safety Protocols that are designed to support [[ValuesCredentials]] related rights and principals, and in-turn address  Social Attack Vectors.\n\nOne of those issues that is of particular importance in my mind, is to ensure that works are defined as to make progress towards Ending Digital Slavery and one of the aspects related to achieving progress in that area is in-turn the [[WorkProject]].\n\nFinally, \n\nThe creation of this community engagement initiative is in-turn also a fairly significant undertaking in and on its own.  As such, note the [[WebCivicsCharter]] and connect via one of the channels provided if you think its something that you might be interested in supporting.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/user-stories/","title":"User-Stories"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# User-Stories\n\nThis is about creating a list of user-stories...\n\n## Basic\n\n- [ ] self\n    - [ ] Date Of Birth (Enumerate Age)\n    - [ ] Place Of Birth\n    - [ ] Language\n        - [ ] Primary\n        - [ ] Other - define, context, competency, rules.\n    - [ ] Location \n    - [ ] Personal\n            - [ ] (home) Local Choice of Law, rules.\n    - [ ] Identity Instruments.\n\n## Personhood\n- [ ] Credential Instruments.\n- [ ] Identifiers (ie: domains,social networks,etc).\n- [ ] Professional\n    - [ ] work / employer - choice of law, rules.\n\n### Social\n\nThe social network concepts of calling everyone 'connections' or 'friends' is malformed.  This needs to change, but i'm not sure of the language - the method is a bit more - sophistocated, and requires namonclature to better support the implications.  \n\n- [ ] Profiles, user can have persona relating to how they want to curate their environment at that time.  There can be made, but the underlying 'soul' is in-effect - integrated.  The difference, seeks to create space for different 'mindsets', to - associatively (not disassocaitively) provide assistance for people needing to organise their lives in different ways. \n\nEXAMPLE; 'work', 'home', 'study', 'director of xyz', 'old skool mates', 'yacht-club', etc... \n\nPeople may segment how they define their social environments based upon these different persona / rules, but underneath the personas, they're still dealing with the same person.  Therein, people might have different roles, names, etc. but its still all integrated - if someone is - ultimately - blocked - it applies to all 'personalities'. \n\n### Other top-level categories\n- [ ] public, discoverable, rules - rules define whether or not people are discoverable.\n- [ ] public, follow, rules - the ability to follow someone elses activities, as a semantic distinction and/or service (ie: RSS)\n- [ ] public, comment / interact, rules - the ability to interact with a 3rd party who is otherwise not at all connected in any way.\n- [ ] introduction - contacts 'unknown' to each-other otherwise - the ability to 'reach out' to create a formal connection, rules.\n- [ ] invitation - contacts have some prior relation - same as 'introduction' but the difference is whether there's some reason why they might know of each-other in some way previously - thereafter seeking to create the semantic connection and related sharing, rules.\n- [ ] curator - The curator, is effectively the semantic agent that defines how the informatics between connections - works.\n\n### Social Dynamics\nOnce people are 'connected' (ie: mutual 'foaf' entries, in-effect, although connected to the values credentials / agreements), then the relationship framework - is - dynamic.  There's no strict classification for any relationship, other than how they're defined semantically between the parties.\n\n- [ ] prior 'connection' contact - so, people meet one-other, form relationships, those relationships grow, flourish, and then sometimes wither and die, sometimes violently - or in ways, that means there's absolutely no contact...  for a period of time, or sometimes - forever... \n\nsituations are all sorts of different.\n\nSo - the methodologies need to consider that the means to manage content - legally (not by seeking pervasive controls / external = well, stuff that's unwanted); the theory is, that the agreements in place, continue to stand for the period of time in which they were in-place, and are therefore also supported technically, in-terms of semantics.  If people no-longer want to have anything to do with one-another, save exceptional circumstances (which is a use-case that needs to be supported) then the content generated during their relationship is still available to each-other, on the terms defined at that time.  breach of those terms, may result in enforcable actions - but - generally, the desire is to keep the content in the system, rather than people storing the content elsewhere, that doesnt have any meaningful relationship to rules at all... \n\nTherefore, when the relationship changes; so does too, the manner in which content is shared between parties.\n\n- [ ] arbritration - the ability to block, via network (ie: due  to abuse, court-outcome, etc.)\n- [ ] reunification - if people have a dispute and temporarily become disconnected\n    - [ ] data from former relationship\n    - [ ] data from period of isolation\n\n## Advanced\n\n### Logic Engine\n- [ ] defining the rules\n- [ ] query process for the rules\n- [ ] data-process involving rules...\n\n### Prolog / Julia\n\nProlog uses semantic web, but julia can do cuda processing  (weights, essentially??) also seemingly better for spatio-temporal stuff, but idk. experiment.\n\nThis in-turn appears to need to be wrapped in rust. \n\nEmbed julia in prolog; \n- https://github.com/samer--/pljulia\n- https://github.com/haldai/Jurassic.pl \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/DocumentationMethod/","title":"Documentation Method"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Documentation Method\n\nThis website is developed with [obsidian](obsidian.md)  and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/WebCivics/docs.humancentricai.org).\n\nIf you would like to contribute towards the development of this documentation, then the best way of doing that is to fork the GitHub Repository, download Obsidian, write some new articles then led us to know where to get the documents via Discord.\n\n### Documentation Environment Installation Instructions \n\nThis process provides a particular approach; there are many different approaches available, including the means to download [obsidian](obsidian.md) and purchase their [sync and/or publish](https://obsidian.md/pricing) services that are designed to work with the obsidian platform. \n\nThe alternative that i've used is described below;\n\n1. Github: \n\ta. A user needs to set-up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. \n\tb. then they need to set-up a github repo to publish their documents #website \n\tc. The user then needs to set-up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Make sure you set the pages link to the gh-pages branch.  Decide whether you want to use the github provided address or add a cname to the dns records of your domainname, sync and add ssl.\n\td. Then they need to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/) and clone the repo to a local storage location.\n\n2. Download and install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n3. Obsidian Gatsby Website Template.\n\te. I've used the [Obsibian Template for Gatsby Theme Primer Wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/)goto the link and download the zip file.\n\tf. upzip the files and copy to the local directory you've created using GitHub Desktop. Then goto GitHub Desktop and right click on the project - selecting the option 'open in visual studio code'\n\tg. edit the ```.layouts/gatsby-config.js``` file to replace the information entered about the author of the template, with the information about your own project / site then save.\n\th. goto ```.layouts/static``` and edit the ```CNAME``` file with your own information then save; and then, create a logo and replace ```logo.png```.\n\t\t\n4. Download and install Obsidian\n\ta. Once obsidian is installed, a screen will come-up and one of the options will be to 'open folder as vault'.  Do that, and find the folder that you've created using github desktop for the gatsby files.  Open it. \n\n\tb. you should now see a list of the existing content that came with the website template.  You can either delete all those files or manage them in some way useful to you.  (ie: create a directory and put it those files into it, etc ).  Then start using obsidian to create your own files.\n\t\n\tObsidian automatically saves files.  \n\t\n5. Publish or Publish Draft\n\tWhen you're ready, go back to github desktop and you should see that your project has a bunch of updates. In Github Desktop, goto the repo (project) create a 'commit' by providing a summary and description, then d hit 'commit to main'; and push the 'pull' button. \n\t\n\tIf you get an error with  ```workspace.json``` right click and add to .gitignore. \n\t\n\ta. Current Branch: Main - The main branch will build the application, and publish it to gh-pages. \n\tb. drafts: if you want to save your draft, but not publish it - try creating a different branch. \n\t\n\tNOTE: GIT has a learning curve.  I've had some difficulties with it, and i'm still working on it. \n\n\nhope that helps! \n\n**NOTE:** I have had some difficulty with syncing. I have found at times, that work appears to have dissappeared.  In-turn also, i've had challenges with git and git-stash requirements, which has led me to figure out how to find files (work) that have 'gone'; and then go and recover it.  \n\nput simply, you've got to goto the git system files and look at the log; then find the hash for the stash that's been lost; and goto command prompt and type in git branch (name of branch - ie: recovered) and then the hash.  Then after its been recovered, there's a process to merge back with the original files.\n\nWhilst the method explained above is intended to be useful; it may also be better, to keep the local docs seperate from docs uploaded to github: so basically, write the docs in obsidian and store your work in progress in a folder somewhere; then, when you want to upload it - copy those files to the github folder location, overwriting old files.  \n\nThe other issue that i've had is that HTML in files can break gatsby; so, in the github actions section (online in github) you'd need to look at what might have gone wrong if the build fails & then fix it. \n\nI'm therefore thinking about how to apply [[EarlyStageIncomeStrategies]] type concepts to get help for people, although i'm not entirely sure how to do that yet. \n\nIn anycase; that's how this development documentation has been produced for the [devdocs.webizen.org](https://devdocs.webizen.org) site.\n\n\n### NOTES\n\n1. Whilst not exhaustive - [issues](https://github.com/WebizenAI/devdocs/issues) are being logged via github. \n2. The DocumentHeading can be overridden by creating a top level Heading\n3.

These rights are intended to encourage innovation and creativity by allowing creators to control the use of their creations and to benefit from their exploitation.\n\nThere are several different types of intellectual property, including:\n\n1.  Copyright: Copyright protects original works of authorship, such as literature, music, and artwork.\n    \n2.  Trademarks: Trademarks protect distinctive words, phrases, symbols, or designs that are used to identify and distinguish a particular product or service.\n    \n3.  Patents: Patents protect new and useful inventions, as well as certain types of discoveries and innovations.\n    \n4.  Trade secrets: Trade secrets protect confidential business information, such as recipes, formulas, and customer lists.\n\nIntellectual property law is designed to balance the interests of creators and the public by granting certain exclusive rights to creators, while also allowing for the use and dissemination of ideas and information for the benefit of society.\n\n## Web Civics Agreement.\n\nThe Copyright and Intellectual Property Agreement for Human Centric AI projects undertaken via this Web Civics community environment, is sought to be considered on a project-by-project basis; and may be subject to one of many different types of Agreements.  \n\nIn future; it is an objective that does in-turn support the [[WebCivicsCharter]] to seek to form apparatus that may act to better support [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst simultaniously seeking to ensure that persons are both properly renumerated for useful [[KnowledgeWork]] in a defined and limited manner; as such, to ensure that works are neither subject to royalties or other financial dues in perpetuity; notwithstanding, the fair and necessary right for persons to be paid fairly for useful works that are the product of their time, choices & use of resources, whether it be their own or those of others who may have supported them to do good work.\n\nAs these systems do not exist, a compromise must be made.  The manner through which this is thought best applied at this stage, is to require persons involved in forming particular projects; to cooperatively define which of the following terms should be applied upon their group works.   These methodologies are sought to be updated and improved upon overtime.\n\nIt is considered that there are a few key areas of importance to be addressed as of now.\n\n1. Other Peoples Intellectual Property and/or Intellectual Property Rights.\n2. Copyright terms for works performed and/or contributed to these efforts.\n3. Software Licensing Terms for works produced and/or contributors in connection with these efforts.\n\n## 3rd Party Works.\n\nIntellectual Property that is contributed for use by the community should be authorised by the copyright / moral owner of those works.  There is a duty to notify where this is not the case, and moreover it is preferred that any such activity is not done at all...  \n\nWorks produced by others should be clearly identified; both in terms of the known author, and/or any known or unknown aspects related to the provonance of the works and/or artifacts.\n\n# Copyright\n\nThe Copyright Agreement for Human Centric AI projects undertaken via this Web Civics community environment, may be subject to one of many different types of Copyright Agreements.  The broader suggestion is that works develop to better support a dual-licensing methodology; this may in-turn act to better support the [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations by being able to better address the needs of different cohorts that exist throughout our societies, without unnecessarily failing to consider the needs of people.\n\nThe three primary instruments that are intended to be employed at this stage; \n\n- [[CC_BY-NC-4.0-License]] - Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International\n- [[CC_BY-SA-4.0-License]] - Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International \n- [[CC_CC0-1.0-Universal]] - Public Domain Dedication No Attribution Required.\n\nFor projects where the objective is considered to be critical to [[ValuesCredentials]] related issues and the implications are such that it doesn't matter how something good happens to improve a situation, its just important that it happens - the Public Domain license, basically means the burden for having done what was required to make it and any consequential issues that may arise, is taken on by the creators; and the derivative works are made free.\n\nThe ShareAlike license is similar, yet the difference is that they must provide attribution; which may in-turn be something that they're able to remove if they elect to engage in-order to obtain a different license.  This is commonly used with photos and other media that may be distributed with this type of license, but the media contains a watermark or identifier.\n\nThe Attribution Non-Commercial is similar to the Attribution ShareAlike, but, the work is not licensed for the purpose of employing it for commercial purposes; but its free to use otherwise, so long as the consumer of it abides by the attribution terms of the license.\n\nA list of other well-known licenses (particularly with respect to software) is made available via the [Open Source Initiative Here](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/OurValues/","title":"Our Values"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Our Values\n\nWeb Civics activities seek to develop a somewhat unique [[CommunityOfPractice]] that works within a particular area, in a manner that is guided by the values set-out by [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments as have been provided via links in said note to the original articles. \n\nFurthermore, we make the continual undertaking to always make [[BestEfforts]], and to seek to ensure the tools that we seek to produce alone or with others are [[FitForPurpose]].\n\nWe seek to improve our capacity to deliver better tooling to support [[FairWorkProtocols]] and in-turn act to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]], whilst forming improved means to support people who work to produce better outcomes, instruments and tooling to support [[SafetyProtocols]], etc."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/WebCivicsCharter/","title":"Web Civics Charter"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Web Civics Charter\n\nThe Web Civics Charter is being defined to provide an outline of what is expected of persons and what persons should expect, when being involved in any Web Civics Project, including but not limited to the communities that have been established to support the positive development of Human Centric AI technologies, policies, recommendations, communities and all such related activities and works.\n\n## Guiding principles & Instruments\n\nThe primary objects that are employed to define expectations with respect to how we are sought to honourably support the welfare, rights and responsibilities that are inextricably linked to our means to support progress in a manner that uplifts human dignity for ourselves, one-another and those who may be impacted by the consequences of our thoughtful behaviours, is defined by way of the [[ValuesCredentials]].

If one of those issues is poorly described, then we welcome assistance in seeking to improve these documents. \n\nIf you are subjected to behaviours that relate to any of those sorts of issues, then the following process is sought to be employed.\n\nIt is important to ensure that any complaint and/or incident is properly documented. Issues can be complex, and sometimes it is also important to protect the person who is alledged to have engaged in wrong-doing when in-fact the real-world situation may well be more complex.  In the event that an incident that gives rise to concerns is identified, please try to obtain a screen-shot or whatever evidence you are able to collect (without unnecessarily breaching the rights of other persons as defined in the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments); and thereby notify either notify a moderator or administrator on the platform you are on; or alternatively, email: abuse@humancentricai.org.   \n\nIf the issue appears to relate to serious criminal issues, it is expected that these matters be reported; so that they may in-turn be, at least, logged.  \n\n### Intellectual Property & Licensing Agreement\n\nUnless otherwise Stated, the works required to produce the community environment online, in connection to the HumanCentricAi.Org project by Web Civics is licensed under [[CC_BY-NC-4.0-License]].

Yet, the underlying issue is considered to be a fairly old issue.  Whether it be the minor 'autocorrect errors' that most have experienced with text messages or other apps; or whether it be, what might become very serious errors in spreadsheets & other important records and/or documents; the ability to ensure there is a means to comprehend who is responsible for what, where, when; has a variety of important ramifications that should be considered and better supported.  This is not unlike accessibility standards now commonplace throughout society whether it be in relation to our civic infrastructure or our online systems and their interfaces on the web, television and otherwise.  \n\nMore broadly, of the importance of providing information about the agent responsible for content associated with (electronic) communiations is becoming increasingly important.  \n\nThis is one of the many considerations that led me to producing these WebCivics - Human Centric AI community works. \n\nMy initial considerations are provided via the notes below.\n\n\n### Problem definition:\n\nAI agents have played a role in the communication between natural persons and other natural persons and/or legal entities via electronic communications for some time.   Most people are familiar with the problems caused merely via autocorrect issues, yet the implications of software agents is becoming more pronounced.\n\nWhilst there are many positive benefits of software agents, there are also risks. \n\nSome of those risks relate to whether or not an observer is able to distinguish between whom or what it is that has produced correspondence or other communications and related derivatives.\n\n### Agent Labelling concept:\n\nThe agent labelling concept is an initiative that seeks to define a technical method to enunciate in a human & machine readable manner what type of agent is responsible for any part of a communicated message.  Messages or content may be wholly or partially generated by a software agent, interactivity with natural & legal agents. \n\nSoftware agents have different classifications and often also names.\n\nIn some mediums these semantics can be illustrated using rdf.  In other circumstances it may be labelled using metadata or even a specific font that by default enables the consumers or observers of content for whom a response is sought to be elicited may thereby be provided information about the provenance of how the information has been generated.   \n\nIn some cases multiple software agents may be involved in the creation of a document or artifact transmitted to others.\n\n## Agent labelling considerations;  \n\n### ​Verifiability / Tamper Evidence vs. \"honour systems\"​\n\nPresently, there is no good method that is built into the technology ecosystem; that I am aware of.  In most cases involving actors whose behaviour is considered to be consistent with 'good', at the time, a solution to address this kind of issue may be something that is considered assistive and the natural person / legal entity will want to make use of it, rather than seeking to misrepresent the provenance of how the content was generated.  In these use cases there are also benefits associated with the ability to clearly denote responsibility in association to any mistakes that may have been made (without seeking to determine responsibility in relation to the effect any such instances may associate with).  This is also a common problem with AutoCorrect technologies that may only act to change a word; yet, the implication of that change may have a significant impact on the interpreted meaning of the document and/or artifact.\n\nIn other instances, the use of Software Agents may be employed far more comprehensively, and it has been shown that some agents have a capacity / propensity to 'make stuff up'[2] and this leads to one of many problems, such as the implication that these agents will at times create misinformation and disinformation. \n\nIn circumstances where an 'honour system' is being employed; the means to easily distinguish what parts were made by which agents, is a function or feature that is sought to be employed by the user / publisher / creator / disseminator of the content / artifact.  Yet this is not always the case - either - in relation to a natural or legal agent on a common or contextual basis.   There are complex social factors that play a meaningful role in seeking to determine an appropriate solution in this area and it may well be the case that there is a large volume of work that would need to be done to mitigate risks related to any misguided and/or misappropriated attempts to pervert the ability to create a solution that is helpful, and does not unnecessarily or disproportionately exert power and/or influence over the use of these sorts of tools.  \n\nThereafter; the greater challenge appears to be to define methods that may support tamper-evidence of artifacts and/or strengthened informatics that provides support for determining the provenance of electronic documents and/or artifacts where the agent is seeking to intentionally deceive and/or mislead the recipient and/or observers.  These sorts of use-cases may apply to institutions of public trust as much as they may also apply to persons engaged in cybercrime.   The implications are not merely related to Ai Agents such as the now publically well known and advanced systems that are increasingly celebrated; but also, as noted earlier, AutoCorrect functions and in-turn also, even spreadsheets.  Whilst any useful solution may not simply be defined via technological standards, but rather an ecosystem approach that might employ both public and/or 'platform' policy in addition to technological tools (methods), the challenge in these latter use cases is complicated by the underlying social factors considering the circumstances whereby the user (transmitter, etc.) expressly does not want there to be a means to distinguish between the work of a software agent and that of their own making (although the two are loosely coupled). \n\n### Types of Software Agents;\n\nnot all software agents are the same.  Different software agents have different qualities, traits and 'relations' / implications.  Natural persons (may) employ software agents as a personal aid; via systems that are private, personal and associated with that natural person, much like a significantly enhanced electronic calculator...   In other instances, large institutions may seek to operate their businesses using advanced designs of software agents to successfully operate their business and mitigate risks via designs that make use of software agents.  one example of these sorts of situations i describe as #NoBodyAI - whereby the notion is, that designs are produced that are intended to have the effect of mitigating risks in a manner where if 'found out' it is intended that any repercussive effects are simply put down to a 'software glitch' or similar, and that no-body (person / legal entity) is responsible. #NoBodyAi.\n\n### Societal Benefit of AI.  \n\nThere are various challenging issues that through the course of my work and related research, I have sought to figure out methods that were not immediately obvious to me, as to address those problems.  Commonly this has involved speaking with the government.  In some of these problem domains, issues are set aside and a great deal of effort (energy / resources) are applied towards the objective purpose of seeking to 'do nothing' (commonly known as 'bureaucracy', which appears to me to be a very kind interpretation when considered in relation to some areas of purposefully good pursuits).  The introduction of Large-Scale AI services brings about an opportunity for persons who would otherwise not be capable of resolving problems that may relate to matters of great importance; including but not exclusive to the human rights of persons, to be supported in seeking to form methods to address those problems.\n\nThese types of circumstances may lead to frictions, between historical and/or traditional barriers and the statements, purpose and considerations made by law and/or other legal and/or ethical/moral contracts and constructs (ie: codes of conduct that are defined and employed in a manner that is consistent with basic legal principles, as are often defined by human rights related instruments, etc.).  This is assumed to be particularly beneficial for persons whose subsistence is experienced in poverty; and that, meaningful assistance by competent professionals has simply not been materially available and/or accessible; and that, in extraordinary circumstances where that may not be the case, these resources may be easily redirected at low cost.  Therein, whilst any such circumstances of poor behaviour may not be consistent with law, if it is never able to be heard - many consider any such approach to be acceptable (ie: risk management);  now therefore, the implication becomes one whereby the introduction of advanced software agents - significantly impacts the broader circumstances.  This is also particularly the case for persons who are considered (rightly or wrongly) to require some sort of advocate and/or guardian, whose statements are said to be unreliable.   Whilst some may seek the same qualities to be built into software, as to allay any threat of exposure that may come about otherwise; these sorts of complex considerations, may also be an important part of a scope of works that considers how to define a more complex approach for agent labelling that acts to prioritize human rights above wrongs, irrespective of the inconvenience that may engender upon some who may seek to be successful via the employment of solutions that represent a different kind of structure.\n\n[2] https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cogai/2023Jan/0009.html\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/CognitiveAI/","title":"Cognitive AI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Cognitive AI\n\nThe Cognative AI strategy is still being more formerally defined, and is likely to be one of the more significant projects that is better undertaken once HumanCentricAI systems are released.  Current work is being undertaken via [[CognitiveAI-WIP]] notes.\n\nCognitive artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that is designed to mimic the cognitive abilities of humans, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing. It is based on the idea that the human brain is a computational system that can be emulated by a machine, and it seeks to build AI systems that can perform tasks that require human-like cognition.\n\nCognitive AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision, which allow machines to learn from data, understand and generate human language, and perceive and understand the visual world in a way that is similar to humans. These technologies can be applied in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and customer service, to assist humans in making decisions, providing personalized recommendations, and completing tasks more efficiently.\n\nHowever, cognitive AI also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for automation to displace human workers, the need for transparency and explainability in AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to perpetuate and amplify biases present in the data used to train it. As a result, the development and use of cognitive AI requires careful consideration of these issues and the responsible design and deployment of these technologies.\n\n### UseCases\n\nSome of the initial use-cases for CogAI will include the TheValuesProject and in-turn therein,  the ability to process a multitude of [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn provide support for Webizen Owners to evaluate whether and/or how an activity may be compliant, compatible and/or promotional of those values or whether and how there may be some sort of conflict.  \n\n### Requirements\nThere must be an open-standards way to perform these sorts of procedural knowledge representation tasks.  This will in-turn support productivity and reduce and/or clarify risks associated with behaviours and/or activities.\n\nThe Area has an array of very complex requirements; however fundamentally, the Web Science related requirement, is to figure out how to form a #HumanCentric Approach; so that, whilst the tools may offer suggestions and/or support, it is fundamentally still only humans that are responsible for making decisions and not Active Artificial Agents ( #AI )\n\n### W3C Cognative AI CG \nWork to produce an open-standard for Cognative AI is being undertaken now in the [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\n\"The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.\"\n\nSource:  [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\nNote also the GitHub link for the [CogAI](https://github.com/w3c/cogai/).\n\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/HumanCentricAI/","title":"Human-Centric AI Ethics"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Human-Centric AI Ethics\n\nOne of the essential objectives is to get to the point where Values Credentials are able to be used whilst defining relationships, as is part of the on-going nature of relationships.\n\nHuman Centric AI has an implied relationship to what might be considered a very different form of 'digital identity' construct; which is only really operationally employable via an agent.\n\n![[Dali_CyberPhysicalHumanDignity.jpg]]\n\nWhilst the notes about sense are more specifically about an underlying system that is required to support the proper use of vocabulary in a way that consequentially supports the use of other systems that depend upon the ability to use sense (or something like it); there are some meaningful implications relating to the use of vocabulary / language, that in-turn link to the topics that are discussed in these notes.  \n\n## Introductory Notes\n\nIt has been a continual area of annoyance that ‘ai ethics’ folk; increasingly, involved due to the significant ‘value’ associated to contracts in the area; but seemingly, devoid of a variety of prerequisite.\n\nWhilst multi-nationals and large institutions go about forming ‘ai ethics’ bodies of work (seemingly not cheap) who are speaking and writing policies about AI Implementations, the subject of their considerations relating to ethics more often relates to systems that are designed to be owned by large corporations - not humans.\n\nWhatever the cause, not much has been done to ensure people can own their own AI Agents; and without that infrastructure, the ability to ensure that human beings have support via electronic systems, digital / web / ‘ai’ systems; even just, to seek access to justice in circumstances that may well lead to innocent & injured people - is not easily achieved.\n\nPeople are subjected to organised violence - ending their lives, severely injuring their quality of life, or having their lives ended - in-effect or materially due to wrongs; that, In my opinion, any good ‘ai ethics’ system - should have reasonable capacity to better understand, sooner.\n\nThe problem is that large entities do not make systems that expose them to legal repercussions willingly.  Consequently, these ‘mainframe’ like - money first policy framework, engenders a form of moral poverty that is, to me, simply detestable.  \n\nI hear from staff members of politicians offices; who suggest, nothing i’ve done has impacted ‘government policy’, whilst the fools are logging into systems that are being developed to in-part depend upon infrastructure that i was involved in creating, globally.  Yet, in my opinion, this isn’t about honesty, its about violence.  Systems that act violently as to in-turn prevoke violence, as the underlying series of assumptions are built upon the acceptability and barriers engendered to limit lawful recourse when persons are disaffected by [[PublicSectorWrongDoings]].  Whilst an extrodinary amount of effort may well see a person be able to have a problem that has been disaffecting them addressed; often, the apparent belief is that any such adjustment should in and of itself be considered lawful remedy, regardless of the broader repercussions any such wrongs may have had upon the target of wrong-doings and/or the intentional employment of [[SocialAttackVectors]] because of how AI is designed to support some [[SafetyProtocols]] without any form of meaningful support for others, including some of those defined already in these documents. \n\n*Notably also; During the course of my R&D works in relation to these ecosystems, it has been made apparent to me that they are less likely to engage in wrong-doing when dealing with professional criminals.  It has been suggested to me, that they prefer to target law abiding citizens because its far easier than targeting criminals, who have advanced their skills as a requirement relating to their profession as a criminal. In-effect, that they’re too hard to sort out; so, they go after the good actors, who they know, they can assault without consequence because - they’re good actors, unwilling to break the law regardless of how it is these people, assault our values, as a society overall.*   \n\nSo.  \n\n### Defining 'Human-Centric Ai Ethics'\n\nThe implication for defining “Human Centric Ai Ethics’ relates to [[WebScience]] considerations; when modelling [[ArtificialMinds]] as to support ‘reality check tech’. Human Centric AI is for those who want to build solutions that improve our capacity to sort out bad actors via courts; via the production of solutions that provide ‘democratisation’ of electronic evidence. This in-turn supports foundational requirements considered necessary in-order to support the ability to do real-world ‘ai ethics’ in ways that was previously impossible as a consequence of designs. \n\nThe Founder of Web Civics is actively working on an HumanCentricAI ecosystem solution implementation that is called Webizen.\n\n![[webizen.jpg]]\n\nWebizen systems are different to modern global cloud 'Mainframes', that are built to support the requirements of rulers - not rights, human rights or other words; has nothing to do with ‘ethics’ in a world, that is said to be about building peace infrastructure.  Yet whilst he continues to progress this long-term project that has had such a big role in defining his life, the underlying purpose of the works - is all about the sorts of things described by in the instruments referred to in the [[ValuesCredentials]]  documentation; whilst the now global [credentials](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) work that is often said to be 'digital identity', that is a derivative of works [he helped to establish](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) sadly, those who became prompted to leadership roles; never quite got to the point where many of the usecases related to [[SafetyProtocols]] including but not limited to [[ValuesCredentials]] were just not part of what ended-up being globally implemented as ID.\n\nIn consideration; \n\n*This video below provides a very quick summary of the difference between rights and rulers.*\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRGhrYmUjU4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n### Economic Benefits of Ethics for Moral Economy Systems\n\nSystems, that are designed to support acts of violence with legal impunity, due to structure of systems designs; and other political-sciences related manoeuvres, don’t cost less. Rather, there is a propensity to engender or employ various types of [[SocialAttackVectors]] in an effort to negate responsibility for whatever the underlying problem actually is; terms that describe these sorts of behaviours include \"passing the buck\" and obstruction.  Innately, these sorts of behaviours incur additional costs whilst failing to deliver an outcome that needs to be resolved in some way, even if the outcome that is engendered is that the victim ends-up dead.  When these sorts of things are exacted upon persons, it has a ripple effect across a multitude of persons, and overall - doesn't improve productivity, support human rights or increase the capacity for gainful revenues to become developed via the success of policies relating to [[SafetyProtocols]], [[ValuesCredentials]], [[WebScience]] or various other measures.\n\n## What is Ethics? \n\nIn the diagram, produced in 2018, as provided below; the distinction between 'moral responsibility' and 'ethical responsibility' is illustrated. \n\n![[2018-9TheCollectiveInfoSphere.webp]]\n\n![[1_iGzdEyUWAzT7TDjU6IUvTQ.webp]]\n\n\nTherein - the distinction becomes one where every individual human being owns the moral responsibility that is associated to his or her actions; yet, in a group situation, the utility of that moral responsibility to make their own personal choices in any given situation may not result in an outcome that is consistant with their view; as such, the prevailing outcome is considered to be the representation of a groups ethical responsibilities. \n\nAs a consequence of there being very little support for individuals (or indeed also, lawful remedy in relation to wrong-doings); there are various distortive effects upon 'ethics' generally, and in-turn also those that relate to the creation of active software agents, that we manifestly call - Artificial Intelligence or AI.  \n\n## HumanCentricAI Differences\n\nThrough the use or application of 'AI Ethics' in relation to HumanCentricAI ecosystems, ‘ethics’ or various values statements that are said to be the guiding instruments bound to their terms of employment; are in-turn subject to semantic ecosystems that ensure they’re not provided the right to assault the human rights of children, or their loved ones as to exploit children. \n\nActions that may be considered to be part of a persons authorised behaviours in connection with an employment contract that may seek otherwise, to provide impunity without insurable (or uninsurable) risk / liability - becomes contextualised via the ability of others to seek lawful consideration via courts of law.  \n\nSo the benefit, of HumanCentricAI for people who actually care about ‘ethics’ or moral equities, socio-economic systems, solutions and the means to use technology as a series of tools to support the interests of our human family; is that through means, to democratise ‘ai servers’ so that there’s a means to include, consideration for natural justice, for the needs, rights, values and considerations of importance for natural persons, in their private capacity; regardless of any other role they may hold in our societies, that there’s now a technical means to figure out how it is, we’re able to make them more meaningful than before.\n\nAs such, new opportunities become available to form more appropriate approaches that can better support the common understanding of what terms like 'ethics' should mean, particularly in relation to public policy and related (endorsed) public / private sector activities.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/TheValuesProject/","title":"The Values Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Values Project\n\nThis was one of the first documents produced, and likely needs to be comprehensively updated - given the importance of this project.  \n\nAn artifact from an old project that has continued to provide me something to refer to when feeling lost about the problems that seem to be inexorable, is this short video, which was produced with the help of [Thomas Keneally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keneally) who wrote the words;

The is consideredto be a critical requirements to support the [[WorkProject]] and in-turn address [[SocialAttackVectors]] and support [[SafetyProtocols]].\n\n## Background Notes\n\nThe values project is premised upon a desire to ensure people are furnished an opportunity to express terms in relation to online contracts.  This in-turn stimulates the development of a symmetrical agreement framework, rather than asymmetrical, as is the case today - as a consequence of the designs & priorities, illustrated by others at large.\n\nThere is presently no known solution to express ‘values’. There is also no good solution for humans to declare preferences with respect to the collection of information or the storage of profiling related information - such as cookies.  Whereas a relatively simple solution to address the ‘pop-ups’ that appear in websites asking for ‘cookie permissions’ would remove the need for these sorts of things, for users; The ‘values’ frameworks, is intended to provide a capacity for persons to define a set of terms that are expected to be honored; and in-turn, as a consequence of contract law - as is used by electronic services to seek rights, that any breach of contract may result in consequences / penalties / enforceable obligations.   \n\nWhilst the basic concept may be employed for purposes not intended (exploits, in-effect - as is personally felt to be the case with the broader ‘platform’ this looks to be deployed with); the purpose of this project at the present-time, is to focus on declarative instruments that are well-known and/or relating to jurisdictional laws.  In particular, the first examples will seek to deploy solutions for SDGs, Human Rights instruments and other ethics related statements of significance for international use.\n\n# Goals\n\n## Technical Goals\n\n1.  To produce a solution that provides a means for a branded images to be used to denote a corresponding values statement; in a manner that,\n    \n\ta.  supports both inspection of the terms via language (ie: english); and also,\n    \n\tb.  Machine Readable Semantics (RDF).\n    \n2.  To furnish the ability for electronic systems to be able to accept these instruments as part of the electronic contracting process; whereby,\n    \n\ta.  The  ‘values’ credentials in relation to their online contracting (“identity”) systems.\n    \n\tb.  That these terms are provided the same legal capacity as the use of other ‘identity’ related instruments used in relation to electronic contracts; and to,\n    \n\tc.  Enable signed documents that are able to be retained in a manner that is ‘tamper evident’ and consistent with the exact copy executed by the parties involved.  \n\n3.  To enable end-users to find, collect & use commonly known ‘values statements’; as a way to empower users to usefully engage with others upon a basis of mutually defined & articulated values (rights & rules) that are important to them online.\n    \n4.  The ability to manage the relationships they’ve made online with other legal entities. \n    \n5.  The ability to distribute these assets in a permissively controlled manner via DLT URIs in addition to HTTP(s) uris. \n\n\n## Social Goals\n\n6.  To illustrate & address the issues that act to hinder the useful purpose of ‘digital identity’ to serve & support the rights of persons; rather than being employed to empower rulers above & beyond rights; by forming the infrastructure needed to address how we fix it. \n    \n7.  To provide a capacity to engage in online projects with others via contract law principles on a basis of ‘shared values’; or in-effect, \n    \n\ta.  Legal tools to better manage relationships with others via electronic contracts. \n    \n\tb.  To Support rights & address issues that seek to dismantle our foundational rights.\n    \n\tc.  To improve the basis upon which we are empowered to work together in peace.\n    \n\td.  To support the ability for people to do good work for humanity - in areas, where there may be ‘dual use’ (or similar) implications, that are not sought to be endorsed or furnished meaningful assistance in any way common to intended purposes.\n    \n\n# Specifications - issues\n\nIn writing these ‘specifications’, there’s a few known issues; such as,\n\n-   The nomenclature;  Terms such as ‘wallet’ as to define a person by their ‘wallet’ is not considered desirable.  \n    \nThinking ATM; it's more like a persons robot app - R2-D2 or a persons ‘digital twin’ control interface & means to create, store & manage evidence.\n\n-   The differences between what is easily achieved vs. what is hoped to be achieved.  Addressing this issue features implications relating to time / resources / talent.\n    \n-   The hope / desire is to define the ‘minimum viable solution’ to then engage in further development, which is hoped to be exponential in nature overtime.\n    \n-   The broader intended ecosystem - is different to the ‘ssi’ ecosystem model; although, it is also desirable to ensure that any dominant ‘platform solutions’ be made compatible. \n    \n\n# Specifications Goals\n\nThe specification goals seek to outline what it is that the design is attempting to triage.  \n\nThere’s a few components to it.\n\n1.  The way in which the ‘Sem Web Ontologies’ are handled generally.\n\ta. [[UnderstandingOntologies]] provides general 'non-technical' information.  \n      \n2.  Ideally, the moral owners of the ‘[[ValuesCredentials]]’ would be stewards of those instruments, versions of them, etc.  \n    \n3.  Presently HTTP Uris are used for ontologies - DLT/DHT ontologies are useful; as such, the objective is to implement PermissiveCommons. \n    \n4.  VerifiableClaims & Credentials  (including the above noted 'values credentials') are also able to be provided by providers / group entities.\n    \n3. There are presently ‘wallets’ that are defined in a particular way, which is in-turn part of a broader ecosystem that is developing.  \n    \n\ta.  I don’t like the term ‘wallet’.  \n    \n\tb. I am also not confident that the specifications of these ‘wallets’ will be ‘fit for purpose’, as such changes might need to be made. \n    \n\tc. There is a desire to store an array of digital artifacts via a ‘personal cloud’ (protected by law) solution; that will end-up having alot of ‘important (s/w files) documents’ in it.  This isn’t simply a ‘wallet’ & its not quite to the extent to which (in future) the hope is to end-up producing a capacity that might be termed an inforg.\n\n4.  The solution will require packages that are built for online platforms like wordpress.\n    \n5.  A major part of the intended purpose of these works, is to end-up with a solution that can be used for collaboratively undertaking online projects with others.  This ‘projects’ element, will in-turn require additional functionality.\n    \n6.  There is a requirement also to support ‘verifiable claims’, which may be different to what are now known as ‘verifiable credentials’.  These requirements would include the ability to define characteristics of persons required to engage in projects.\n    \n8.  The ‘values’ credentials are intended to support ‘logic’ processes that will progressively improve support for compliance tracking & relationships between credentials.\n    \n9.  A modeling requirement will be needed, in time, to support arbitration considerations where values stipulated in one of the values' credentials, has considerations that may conflict with others; as evaluated on a situation-specific basis. \n    \n10.  Seniors (in particular) have problems retaining their password / username details for websites, something that is similar to what is known as a ‘password manager’ is required. There is also ‘hearsay’ that suggests government workers in agencies relating to national security & defense, may not be properly (securely) storing their access credential information (ie: putting the information into a document that’s stored on their desktop).\n    \n11.  Designs need to consider how solutions will scale to support the needs of persons whose decisions are able to be made as a consequence of consent by a guardian.  A way to address these sorts of issues was historically attempted through the lens of a ‘pets app’. \n    \n12.  Another use-case of importance (i think) is the ability to support ‘annotations’ on content.\n    \n\n# Specifications Resources & Considerations\n\n I am advised that the US company SpruceID ( [https://github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid) ) has been doing good work. I note in particular, their libraries for a ‘did kit’ and also a ‘did wallet’ solution.  It does not appear that the ‘did’ / ‘ssi’ solution presently supports functionality otherwise produced (earlier) for the education market; whereby notes include,\n\n-   [https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html](https://imsglobal.github.io/openbadges-specification/ob_v3p0.html)\n    \n-   [https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/](https://www.badgewallet.eu/en/) \n\nWhereby the problem with ‘open badges’ is that they’re very much designed for education / academia; rather than an ability for people to have a similar sort of thing, relating to values.\n\nA related, desirable requirement; is to produce the tooling required to support the means for people to articulate licenses & other terms in relation to work activities online (inc. accrued rights); alongside, a means to support the ability for web-sites, to support membership and/or privacy related ‘credentials’; which would have the effect of addressing two linked issues,\n\n1.  The GDPR pop-up issue could be addressed for users of this ‘Digital Vault’’.\n    \n2.  The ‘membership’ and/or related instruments (could be group instruments / affiliations, etc.) could better support the means to address ‘micro-payments’ use-cases for content that is not otherwise publicly available. \n    \n\nMore sophisticated considerations; relating to ‘cyber security’ / sensitive projects, confidence, etc.\n\n‘[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)\n\nThere are circumstances where people will be bound to obligations (ie: employment or professional obligations) that preclude them from being able to engage on a basis that may otherwise be afforded to them;  support for considerations are important.\n\nThere is also; a significant desire for support for instruments; that may be private and/or sensitive in nature, such as clearances, vetting, police / working with children checks, etc. \n\nThis may also include a requirement to have credentials should there be problems with these sorts of ‘checks’, as may be taken into account by others when seeking to engage in fair-dealings.\n\nAlso - there should be means to address personal & humanitarian related issues; relating to mental health / illness & treatment related characteristics that should seek to better support people who are acting honestly & responsibly, rather than those who deceptively seek gainful benefits otherwise - this is in-turn, not intended to act punitively; rather, to support security.\n\nFinally; the intended ‘cyber security schema’, featured various constituent components to the overarching authentication fabric, which was in-turn an enabler for activity related factors. The effect was, to bring about an ecosystem solution - that is more appropriate for real-world security capabilities - subject to - deployment methodologies, law & operational capabilities. \n\nSome of these more complex considerations are desirable, but perhaps treated differently. \n\nNOTE:  In related work, there are various projects that will be seeking to employ these tools; whilst also, making them available for broader use.   The projects i’m particularly focused on presently are as follows;\n\n1.  An International Peace Infrastructure Project\n    \n2.  A Cyber capabilities project (domestic)\n    \n3.  A ‘community’ app & related ecosystem (for FNQ). \n\n\nWhilst the ‘initial requirements’ for each of these projects do have differences; there are also core requirements that are sought to be employed for all of them; and, as a consequence of ‘human centric designs’, it is expected that at least some people who seek to use this ‘identity solution’ will be involved in all of these projects, alongside many more.  \n\nThe expectation is that there will be an array of authentication & cyber-security technologies used to create a form of ‘informatics fabric’ that seeks to produce a hardened trustworthy environment;  this is not similar to the design of ‘SSI’ & related commercial solutions; yet, the design of the underlying technologies later used for SSI relates to the history of these tools.\n\n## Addressing the ‘social factors’;\n\nThe concept of addressing the social factors has been an on-going ‘discussion’, with little progress; and much of the progress that has been made, done in ways that weren’t ‘all good’.\n\nThere is a vital requirement to set-up a capacity for people to expressly state terms they seek to be employed in the online contracts they enter into online; and in-turn, furnish an opportunity for a market-segment of online services that support this sort of social-ideology, to grow and i believe - flourish.  There are many, many ‘projects’, or jobs / things about peace, human rights - good stuff, areas of work - that needs to be done; but it can’t reasonably be done in a manner that is built upon a propagated belief that the idea of ‘web slavery’ or ‘digital slavery’ or any form of slavery / abuse of human rights & other related values - should be considered fair or reasonable or ok in any way whatsoever - when its clearly not. \n\nThere is a change in modality that is able to be achieved - as is otherwise required - for the ‘more sophisticated use-cases’ alongside the needs of people, who seek a life - of respect, dignity & fairness unto ‘rule of law’, including a capacity to engage with civic (ie: elections) & civics (ie: peace infrastructure, or advocating for means to address social problems / issues) activities…\n\nSome of these requirements do in-turn require a means to have a safe space to store records of importance.   This is presently not very well provided for by existing solutions that now thereby define the nature of the ‘identities’ of the persons who’ve been involved & the values of their groups.  Whilst it is hoped that these sorts of exhibits will be positively influenced through the production of technology - that led to the way things are done today - to be made, to function as intended - it is also expected, that some people will always prefer alternatives for various reasons; in this way, its not unlike the circumstance of ‘freedom of religion’, whereby the concept of choice - is intended to be empowering, and not a device to force others to comply, in circumstances where the implications are knowingly unlawful & without lawful remedy by design. \n\n## The use of PNG or SVG Containers\n\nThe concept is to use PNG, SVG or other suitably defined image formats as a form of container format for VerifiableClaims & Credentials is a fairly old concept, that was instrumental to the OpenBadges designs.  The 'image' format (particularly SVG) may be interactive / dynamic or may be static.  The Container would then also include the semantic ontology formatted to support presentation of what that asset communicates both in a human readable form and in a format that can be consumed by software agents (rdf).  \n\nIn the future there may be a better definition for a file-container method that becomes standardized as something other than an SVG; nonetheless, its thought - SVGs will do for now. \n\n## Temporal support\n\nWhilst it is desirable to start with the ‘values credentials’ that have static meanings or are represented in a manner that defines the version (noting - new version of laws emerge all the time, perhaps a qualification URI should check for any new versions as to support validity); as does, the circumstances in which the credential was used.  As such, there are a variety of time-stamps that are important to employ, as to ensure historical records remain accurate.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/WorkProject/","title":"The Work Project"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# The Work Project\n\nThe 'Work Project' has a multitude of constituencies, and is basically motivated by a desire to support human dignity in relation to [[KnowledgeWork]]. \n\n### Index\n\n- [[ContributionClassifications]]\n\t- [[Resources]]\n\t\t- [[EquipmentAndSupplies]]\n\t\t- [[LabourWork]]\n\t- [[KnowledgeWork]]\n\t\t- [[IntellectualProperty]]\n\t\t- [[LicensingFrameworks]]\n- [[WorkValuationMethods]]\n- [[Currencies]]\n\t- [[ESG]]\n\t\t- [[EnergyCalcs]]\n\t\t- [[BiosphereCalcs]]\n\t\t- [[SocioshereCalcs]]\n- [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]]\n\nSome very early stage front-end works have been started and are available in this repo on [github](https://github.com/WebCivics/CooperativeProjects).  Yet, there is a long-history of related works and links that i'll add to the Work Project folder at some stage (when i get to it)...\n\nThe Work project is perhaps one of the most essential elements to the broader Peace Infrastructure Project, including but not limited to; the enabling works described as being constituencies of WebCivics alongside that of Webizen are intended to produce an environment that supports the means to provide economic models that better support the needs of those who are primarily engaged in fields of [[KnowledgeWork]] in particular; yet, the methodologies have an array of other applications more broadly.\n\nThese other usecases will seek to consider producing a means to provide tools for people whose lives would be benefited if they were more easily able to manage their ability to engage with a multitude of employers and those whose type of work involves multiple clients  providing payments for their services; alongside other use-cases more broadly.  \n\nHowever, the fundamental requirement of the work prject, is to support both; the works relating to the development of WebCivics, which will continue to develop works that are more focused on WebScience activities; alongside, Webizen and the WebizenAlliance (and/or WebCivics Alliance) requirements. The means to do anything else hinges upon the ability to produce a platform that is designed to be made able to support how any other forms of work are able to be done, using it.  As such; the critical technical requirements are now being made part of the Human Centric Web project. It is hoped that better solutions will emerge through the growth of participants doing useful works (or works that become useful).\n\n## Background Notes\n\nThe Work Project is something that various attempts have been made to produce since 2000. \n\nIn 2019 a study was undertaken listing all of the [[ValueAccountingInitiatives]] that existed at that time, as an effort was being made to raise capital to put some pieces together; and then, 2000 rolled around and alot of things changed for a lot of people. \n\nFundamentally, when seeking to apply these considerations towards the intended focus of seeking to ensure [[BestEfforts]] are being made towards [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] whilst seeking to improve how [[ValuesCredentials]] are materially supported; in areas relating to the use of resources for the production of works that have an intended purpose of being good for humanity (ie: stuff, that's not really purely 'commercial' in form); but that it is entirely reasonable (indeed important) that persons are treated equitably, particularly those engaged in activities that are focused upon achiving positive outcomes linked to [[ValuesCredentials]] related considerations.  Certainly, the idea that such forms of work should be exploited and punitively discouraged; whilst actively promoting and endorsing via transactional activity those who gainfully do the opposite, certainly brings with it an array of implications.\n\n*ideologies that are not compatible with [[WebCivicsCharter]] or related instruments...*\n\nThe applied consideration; Is to support a framework where all forms of [[ProjectFinancing]] are treated equally.  That is, that if unpaid or funded work is undertaken by someone and the useful derivatives of that contribution are useful; then, they're treated in the same way as any other investor - subject to an array of particular terms, to better contextualise the nature of the circumstance, etc.  This seeks to engender rules that basically act to support 'good faith relations' in a manner that attends to the intended meaning fo the statements outlined by the [[ValuesCredentials]] instruments,  structurally.\n\nThereafter, there is an array of [[ContributionClassifications]] that are importantly defined which then have implications on the [[WorkValuationMethods]] and in-turn also, the licensing frameworks.  \n\nThere are an array of [[SocialAttackVectors]] that will directly target these constituencies of the ecosystem.  It is important that there are both clear rules and systems in place to address disputes.  The [[LicensingFrameworks]] will be particularly attentive to circumstances in which works relate to the fundemental rights of Human Beings (ie: Core [[ValuesCredentials]] ); and will distinguish between natural persons (human beings), organisations with reduced means vs. users who are enterprise, large corporations, Government and other similar sorts of entities whose nature is different and that there is a capacity to form licensing frameworks for those types of users in a manner that distinguishes their obligations differently to those of others. \n\nThis type of mechanism is intended to provide the means to support [[KnowledgeWork]] compensation for the development and creation of tooling that is required to support the foundational requirements of tooling relating to the Peace Infrastructure Project in a manner that seeks compensatory revenues (income) from organisations; whom, for example, may be defined as having a cash flow of above $3m AUD Per Annum or by way of structural identity frameworks (ie: in circumstances where analysis is not feasible); as may be determined; whilst,\n\n*Providing the derivative tooling free of charge to all other users.*  \n\nIn other circumstances; where the work-derivative is some sort of 'optional' `#thing` then the cost may be collected from all users at some rate defined by the projects leaders; but that, the overall compensatory amount is sought to be built upon a fixed return for the total effort calc (ie: [[ProjectFinancing]] ); for whatever that body of work is defined as being.  In some cases, work will continue to provide new versions and/or additional maintainence and support for whatever that thing is; which in-turn, ends-up being attributed to the economic frameworks associated with that thing.\n\nWhilst conceptually supported; yet not at all the focus at present, if someone invents something that is entirely optional, as in - its a market based product that might be distinct, yet, a persons life (ie: [[ValuesCredentials]] ) are not going to be disaffected by not having it; then, whoever sells it is entirely entitled to seek to charge whatever they want; and if people want to pay for it, that's really upto them.  as they say 'its a free market'; yet, these sorts of considerations do not apply to works that are critical for Peace Infrastructure Project related purposes.  \n\n**Donations**: if people want to make donations or gift to persons above and beyond the project related economic protocols; that's ok, but also not sought to be required.\n\n### Do You Want to Get Involved?\n\nWe're just starting to invest more into this initiative, if you're interested in getting involved please checkout the [[WebCivicsCharter]] which will in-turn provide the links to the community sites."},{"fields":{"slug":"/notes/WIP/bookmarks/","title":"Bookmarks.md"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Bookmarks.md\n\n\"Bookmarks\" is work in progress.\n\n1.

It's used to reason about entities within that domain and can be used to describe the domain in a formal way.\n\nA \"personal ontology\" refers to a similar concept, but it is tailored to an individual's specific knowledge, experiences, and understanding of the world. This includes their personal categorizations, relationships, and interpretations of concepts and ideas.\n\nFor example, a medical doctor and a software engineer might have very different personal ontologies about the concept of \"Java\". The doctor might associate \"Java\" primarily with the Indonesian island or a type of coffee, while the engineer would more likely think of it as a programming language. These differences in interpretation and understanding are reflective of their personal ontologies.\n\nPersonal ontologies are subject to change and evolution as individuals acquire new knowledge, experiences, and alter their perspectives.\n\nThe idea of personal ontologies has been discussed in various areas, including personalized search, personal knowledge management, and user profiling in the context of semantic web technologies. By understanding a person's ontology, a system can potentially provide more tailored, relevant and personalized results or recommendations.\n\nIn the social sciences and consciousness studies, the term \"personal ontology\" often refers to the set of beliefs, assumptions, and conceptual frameworks that an individual uses to understand, interpret, and interact with the world. It pertains to the questions related to existence, reality, and the nature of being that influence a person's perception of themselves and their surroundings.\n\nPersonal ontology, in these contexts, can include assumptions about the nature of reality (e.g., what exists, what doesn't), about knowledge (e.g., what can be known, how it can be known), and about values (e.g., what is good, what is bad). These beliefs influence the individual's thoughts, actions, and interpretations of experiences.\n\nFor example, one person might have a personal ontology that includes the belief in the existence of a higher power or spiritual realms, which would affect their perception and understanding of the world in a certain way. Another person might have a personal ontology that is strictly materialistic or atheistic, which would lead to a different interpretation of life events.\n\nUnderstanding a person's ontology can be crucial in fields like psychology, where therapeutic approaches often involve exploring and challenging a person's ontological assumptions. It is also of relevance in areas like cultural studies, where different groups or societies may have contrasting ontological assumptions leading to different worldviews.\n\n## Facts\nNeed to define 'facts'\n\n### Values Credentials\n\nValues Credentials need to define 'facts' associated to the statements made by a machine readable / processable document.

It is generally understood to mean that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired result, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result.\n\nIn contrast, behavior that is intentionally harmful, exploitative, or a willful breach of an agreement of fair dealings would involve a conscious choice to act in a way that is detrimental to others or that goes against the terms of an agreement. This type of behavior would not be considered to be making a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as it would be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions rather than a desire to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nTo expand on my interpretation, \"best efforts\" refers to an obligation or promise to use a reasonable level of care and diligence in achieving a particular result. This means that a person will make a good faith effort to achieve the desired outcome, but does not guarantee that the result will be achieved. \"Best efforts\" does not require someone to go beyond what is reasonable or to sacrifice their own interests in order to achieve the desired result. This means that if something goes wrong or the desired result is not achieved, it is not necessarily a breach of the obligation as long as the person has made a good faith effort to achieve the result.\n\nIn contrast, mistakes that are made intentionally are different because they involve a conscious choice to act in a certain way, rather than being an unintentional or unforeseen outcome. Intentional mistakes are typically made with the knowledge that they are likely to result in a negative outcome, and may be motivated by selfish or malicious intentions. These mistakes would not be considered to be made in good faith or as a \"best effort\" to achieve a desired result, as the person making the mistake is acting in a way that is not in line with the goal or purpose of the activity.\n\nSource: Chat.OpenAi.com"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/OurValues/CommunityOfPractice/","title":"Community of Practice"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Community of Practice\n\n### What is a 'Community of Practice'?\n\nA Community of Practice is defined in [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) in the following way;\n\nA **community of practice** (**CoP**) is a group of people who \"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly\".[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#cite_note-1) The concept was first proposed by [cognitive anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology \"Cognitive anthropology\") [Jean Lave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lave \"Jean Lave\") and educational theorist [Etienne Wenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Wenger \"Etienne Wenger\") in their 1991 book _Situated Learning_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)). Wenger then significantly expanded on the concept in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_ ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWenger1998)).\n\nA CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop personally and professionally ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFLaveWenger1991)).\n\nCoPs can exist in physical settings, for example, a lunchroom at work, a field setting, a factory floor, or elsewhere in the environment, but members of CoPs do not have to be co-located. They form a \"virtual community of practice\" (VCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFDub%C3%A9BourhisJacob2005)) when they collaborate online, such as within discussion boards, newsgroups, or the various chats on social media, such as #musochat centered on contemporary classical music performance ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFSheridan2015)). A \"mobile community of practice\" (MCoP) ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFKietzmannPlanggerEatonHeilgenberg2013)) is when members communicate with one another via mobile phones and participate in community work on the go.\n\nCommunities of practice are not new phenomena: this type of learning has existed for as long as people have been learning and sharing their experiences through storytelling. The idea is rooted in [American pragmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pragmatism \"American pragmatism\"), especially [C. S. Peirce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Peirce \"C. S. Peirce\")'s concept of the \"[community of inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_inquiry \"Community of inquiry\")\" ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFShields2003)), but also [John Dewey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey \"John Dewey\")'s principle of learning through occupation ([](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice#CITEREFWallace2007)).\n\nThe Concept of a ‘community of practice’ is considered to be more involved that simply having a ‘community standards’ statement or similar; that has historically been shown to be susceptible to be written or re-written, by project owners to most benefit those authors whilst mitigating risks due to wrongs that may have occurred; and/or, issues that the group leaders have no interest in addressing.\n\nOne of the areas of particular interest to me - is to support human rights; including, but not limited to, ensuring equitable treatment of people who contribute useful work, when it is found to be valuable; and to ensure ‘probity’ / support for human dignity; by seeking to protect against acts of ‘intellectual dishonesty’, such as re-writing someone's former work then displacing provenance; as is often motivated by simplified economic concepts employed by lay-people and/or bad actors. \n\nThe requirements to address these sorts of ‘community of practice’ considerations; do evolve, but must start somewhere - as is part of the consequence of my writing / doing this work; alongside my means to employ concepts / information - I'm aware of; that supports improved communications. \n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/OurValues/FairWorkProtocols/","title":"Fair Work Protocols"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Fair Work Protocols\n\nThe Development of Fair Work Protocols, is an essential component to producing any solution that has any capacity whatsoever for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\nThe Considerations relate to a problem that is fundamentally very old, and indeed also quite complex.  In consideration, a lens of considering the past - in particular, the 8 hour movement and related historical contexts are thought useful when considering how a means to address these sorts of complex problems, might be addressed. \n\n### About the 8-Hour Movement\nThe [8-hour movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day) was a labor movement that sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers by advocating for the reduction of the workday to 8 hours. The movement emerged in the late 19th century, at a time when many workers were subjected to long and grueling workdays, often working 12 hours or more per day.\n\nThe 8-hour movement argued that reducing the workday to 8 hours would improve the health and well-being of workers, as well as increase productivity and efficiency. The movement used a variety of tactics to promote its goals, including strikes, boycotts, and lobbying efforts.\n\nThe 8-hour movement was successful in achieving many of its goals. In many countries, labor laws were enacted that set limits on the length of the workday and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 8 hours per day. In the United States, the 8-hour movement played a key role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek and established the right to overtime pay for work beyond 40 hours per week.\n\nOverall, the 8-hour movement was a significant force in the fight for workers' rights and helped to improve the working conditions and well-being of millions of workers around the world.\n\nActivities that are a form of work are those that are performed for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services. These activities may involve physical or mental labor and may be performed for an employer or as self-employment. Examples of work activities include:\n\n1.  Manufacturing goods\n2.  Providing services, such as consulting or healthcare\n3.  Teaching or lecturing\n4.  Performing research\n5.  Writing or creating content\n6.  Sales or marketing\n7.  Managing a business\n\nWork activities are typically distinguished from recreation and sleep activities in that they are undertaken for the purpose of earning a living or producing goods or services, rather than for leisure or relaxation. However, it is important to note that what is considered work may vary depending on cultural and societal context, and some activities that are considered work in one context may be considered recreation in another.\n\nThe principles of the 8-hour movement, which sought to improve working conditions and protect the rights of workers in the industrial era, can be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in a number of ways. Some potential approaches could include:\n\n1.  Adjusting the focus: Rather than focusing solely on the number of hours worked, the principles of the 8-hour movement could be adapted to address issues specific to knowledge work, such as the need for flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance.\n    \n2.  Strengthening worker protections: Knowledge workers may not have the same level of legal protections as traditional workers, such as the right to unionize or the protection of labor laws. Policymakers and advocacy groups could work to strengthen protections for knowledge workers, such as by establishing new regulations or extending existing protections to cover this group.\n    \n3.  Promoting fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Advocacy groups and policymakers could work to promote fair compensation for knowledge work, such as by establishing guidelines or standards for fair pay.\n    \n4.  Supporting education and training: The principles of the 8-hour movement could also be rejuvenated by supporting education and training programs that help knowledge workers to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their careers. This could include initiatives to promote lifelong learning and provide access to educational opportunities for knowledge workers.\n    \n\n### Forming an applied Methodology for Knowledge Workers\nThere are many ways that the principles of the 8-hour movement could be rejuvenated and applied to knowledge work in order to support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers. By adjusting the focus to address the specific needs of knowledge workers, strengthening worker protections, promoting fair compensation, and supporting education and training, it is possible to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work. This can help to ensure that knowledge workers are able to contribute their skills and expertise to society, while also being able to enjoy a high quality of life and work-life balance.\n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may differ from that of traditional workers in a number of ways. Some potential differences could include:\n\n1.  Flexibility: Knowledge work often requires a high level of flexibility, as knowledge workers may need to be able to adapt to changing demands and priorities. This may involve working outside of traditional business hours or working from different locations.\n    \n2.  Autonomy: Knowledge workers may also have a higher level of autonomy, as they may be responsible for managing their own work schedules and priorities. This can allow for greater control over the balance between work, recreation, and sleep activities.\n    \n3.  Boundaries: The boundaries between work, recreation, and sleep may be less clear for knowledge workers, as they may be required to be available and responsive to work-related demands outside of traditional business hours. This can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy balance between these activities.\n    \n\nThe nature of the concept of time spent engaged in work, recreation, and sleep activities for knowledge workers may be more flexible and autonomous than for traditional workers, but it may also involve a greater challenge in maintaining a healthy balance between these activities.\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their time spent doing work is important for a number of reasons:\n\n1.  Fair compensation: Knowledge work can often be highly skilled and specialized, and knowledge workers may be entitled to fair compensation for their contributions. Paying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work can help to ensure that they are fairly compensated for their efforts and expertise.\n    \n2.  Motivation and retention: Fair compensation can also be important for motivating and retaining knowledge workers. If knowledge workers feel that they are not being fairly compensated for their work, they may be less motivated to perform at their best or may be more likely to leave for other opportunities.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Payment can also help to respect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers. If knowledge workers are not compensated for their useful works, they may not have the financial resources to enforce their intellectual property rights or may be less likely to assert their rights in the face of potential exploitation.\n    \n\n#### Building an Equitable Future for Creators\n\nPaying knowledge workers for the useful derivatives of their work is important for ensuring that they are fairly compensated, motivated, and able to assert their intellectual property rights. This can help to create a more supportive and fair environment for knowledge work, which can benefit both knowledge workers and society as a whole.\n\nIncome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as having a steady and sufficient source of income can provide access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\nFor example, having a sufficient income can allow a person to afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care, which can help to ensure physical safety and well-being. Income can also provide access to financial resources that can be used to protect against financial risks, such as the ability to afford insurance or save for emergencies.\n\nIn addition, income can often be used to purchase goods and services that can help to ensure safety, such as security systems or emergency services. Having a sufficient income can also allow a person to afford legal representation or other forms of advocacy, which can be important for protecting their rights and interests.\n\nincome is often closely related to a person's ability to keep themselves safe, as it provides access to a range of resources and protections that can help to ensure safety and security.\n\n\n### Relationship to Web Science Tasks\n\nThere are a number of web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. Some potential areas of investigation could include:\n\n1.  Workflow and productivity: Web science research could explore how different workflows and technologies impact the productivity and well-being of knowledge workers. This could include studying the effects of remote work, flexible work schedules, and collaborative tools on worker outcomes.\n    \n2.  Fair compensation: Web science research could also examine how to design fair compensation systems for knowledge workers, including exploring the use of algorithms and other tools to assess the value of different types of knowledge work.\n    \n3.  Intellectual property rights: Web science research could also explore ways to protect the intellectual property rights of knowledge workers, including studying the effectiveness of different approaches to licensing and copyright.\n    \n4.  Work-life balance: Web science research could examine how to support work-life balance for knowledge workers, including studying the impact of different work environments and policies on worker well-being.\n    \n\nThere are many different web science questions that could be investigated in order to support the development of fair work protocols for knowledge workers. By studying these issues, web science can help to inform the design of policies and practices that support the rights and well-being of knowledge workers.\n\n### ESG Implications \n[[ESG]] (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in a number of ways. For example:\n\n1.  Social criteria: Developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers could be considered a social issue, as it relates to the well-being and rights of workers. Ensuring that knowledge workers are treated fairly and are able to work in a supportive and healthy environment could be seen as a key element of a company's social responsibility.\n    \n2.  Governance criteria: Fair work protocols can also be related to governance criteria, as they can help to ensure that a company is governed in a transparent and accountable manner. Developing and implementing fair work protocols can help to demonstrate a company's commitment to responsible and ethical business practices.\n    \n\nOverall, ESG criteria can be related to the importance of developing fair work protocols for knowledge workers in that they can help to ensure that companies are addressing key social and governance issues and are committed to responsible and ethical business practices. By considering ESG criteria in the development of fair work protocols, companies can help to ensure that they are contributing to a more sustainable and equitable society."},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/OurValues/FitForPurpose/","title":"Fit For Purpose"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Fit For Purpose\n\n*Content produced quickly via ChatGPT*\n\n>*When designing tools that form part of an ecosystems solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems; how would you define a rule or condition that a useful component should be 'fit for purpose', define 'fit for purpose'..*\n\nThe term \"fit for purpose\" refers to the extent to which a product, service, or system is suitable or appropriate for the specific purpose or use for which it was designed. When designing tools as part of an ecosystem solution that is implemented using software and socio-economic systems, it is important to ensure that each component is \"fit for purpose\" in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the overall solution.\n\nTo ensure that a component is \"fit for purpose,\" it is necessary to consider a number of different factors. These might include the specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the component, the technical capabilities and limitations of the component, and any regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met.\n\nOverall, a component is considered \"fit for purpose\" if it meets the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders, and if it performs the functions it was designed to perform in an effective and efficient manner.\n\n\n> *What sorts of considerations should be made to evaluate whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular usecase?*\n\nThere are several considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case. Some of the key considerations might include:\n\n1.  The specific requirements or needs of the users or stakeholders: It is important to carefully consider the specific needs and requirements of the users or stakeholders who will be interacting with the solution. This might include factors such as the tasks they will be performing, the information they need to access, and any specific constraints or limitations they may face.\n    \n2.  The technical capabilities and limitations of the solution: It is also important to consider the technical capabilities and limitations of the solution, and to ensure that it is capable of performing the tasks it was designed to perform. This might include factors such as the performance, scalability, and reliability of the solution.\n    \n3.  Any regulatory or compliance requirements: Depending on the context in which the solution will be used, there may be certain regulatory or compliance requirements that must be met. It is important to carefully consider these requirements and to ensure that the solution is compliant.\n    \n4.  The cost and value of the solution: It is also important to consider the cost of the solution and to ensure that it provides good value for money. This might involve comparing the cost of the solution to the benefits it is expected to provide, and determining whether the benefits outweigh the costs.\n    \n\nOverall, these are just a few of the key considerations that should be made when evaluating whether or not a solution meets the specific needs of a particular use case.\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/About/OurValues/SupportForHumanAgency/","title":"Support for Human Agency"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Support for Human Agency\n\nEngendering design modals / models, in a manner i broadly describe as 'Human Centric'; which may therefore also be described as Human Centric AI and Human Centric Web; denotes a significant shift in the design topology for how electronic and/or information communications infrastructure and related knowledge & AI systems, are designed and deployed.  This note is linked to the considerations made about [[GuardianshipRelations]] and in-turn the responsibility upon all who support [[ValuesCredentials]] to ensure our behaviour acts in a manner that assists us all to ensure that we are always [[ProtectingDependants]].\n\nAt the heart of this topology; in so far as it is being designed with the express intention to support, is a methodology that brings the human agent into the ownership structures as the first-class stakeholders.  To illustrate this, i have made a copy of some of the notes i have been producing about a seperate project that i call 'webizen'.  In this model; the effect of how HumanCentricAI is furnished to natural persons, and in-turn also groups, is by 'users' purchasing their 'webizen' as property, so taht they own it; and in-turn, become their own 'platform provider'.  Whilst other HumanCentricAI systems might find other ways to address difficult problems,  I will employ some of the considerations that i am making with Webizen, in-order to illustrate the general gist of the idea; and thereby provide support for insights.\n\n### Individuals\n\nThere are various complexities within this topic and those that in-turn depend upon it (ie: support for webizen agents that are 'owned' by an incorporated entity / legal personality (as distinct to natural legal person)); for now, this document seeks to discuss the considerations as they relate to individuals.\n\nThe Diagram Below make an attempt to describe the elements involved. \n\n![[webizen_diagram_1-2.jpg]]\n\n**Description of Diagram Concepts:**\nIn the above diagram; there is a Webizen Agent, which is the tooling used to power the ecosystem; this is in-turn plugged into a web-server, that is connected via tailscale to a public point of presence, that is required to support domain-name resolution (DNS).  \n\nThe consideration becomes; that perhaps there are effectively two seperate databases, one that is a persons ***'personal vault' database***, which is owned by them and contains the resources that have not been provided to anyone else.  Whilst the personal-vault database can be stored on multiple devices, and may contain different amounts of the overall data-volume on each device - this database is owned by the 'webizen owner'...  \n\nSeperately, is the ***permissive commons database***, which contains data that has electronic contracts associated to its use & modification, is in-effect a commons system; that is stored in a decentralised manner in-order to support various processing and networking related functional requirements.   The contents held in the webizen network providers permissive commons environment may be substantially different to the contents held by a webizen owner; although, any content that is permissively able to be shared with either may be.\n\n***NOTE:** Permissive Commons is another Web Civics Project.  It is intended to produce decentralised multi-protocol supported systems, that radically uplift how we manage 'commons'; therein also noting, [[WhatAreTheCommons]] defines the intended meaning.*\n\n### Families\n\nBy extension, the design concept might be that each competent natural legal person has their own webizen 'private vault'; and that resources relating to the union of persons, thereby end-up being a form of highly-encrypted resource that's stored in the permissive commons technology ecosystem; with the exception of the systems / records, relating to other human beings, such as children or others whom someone has a relationship of legal and/or medical guardianship... \n\n#### Guardianship Semantics\n\nThis in-turn is intended to provide support for users to employ the webizen related infrastructure as an entity who has individual rights, responsibilities and capacities as an natural legal person to thereby engage with others; form contracts, including those that relate to shared rights as defined via electronic agreements (ie: permissive commons technology related - shared rights / responsibilities).

exist.  The future [[TheValuesProject]] outcome is prodominately designed to provide the software required for people to more respectfully engage in contracts with others online directly between one another; and in-turn, they are also able to vary their agreements and make their own independent decisions about what to do in circumstances where values have been breached.  To enable these systems, more work needs to be done during this development stage.  As such, the ability to engender agency for persons in a manner that is considered [[FitForPurpose]] is not able to be better achieved until the technology that furnishes the means to do so, has been successfully accumplished. As such, the notes about the present-development stage is of instrumental importance until it is otherwise declared.\n\n#### The present development stage\n\n[[TemporalSemantics]] are kinda useful, so i'll make a note as of the time that i am now therefore writing this note. These notes will be updated overtime, and the information will be supplimented rather than replaced - save exceptional circumstances, etc.\n\n##### 3rd Feb 2023: notes\n\nPursuant to the notes made in the [[GuideForDevelopers]] and related [[WebizenTerms]] which is now therefore being developed primarily to support the [[WebizenDiscord]] channel; where there are conflicting values that are otherwise noted in one or more of the values related instruments noted above; a degree of [[BestEfforts]] to form a common-sense opinion / position, is overwhelmingly considered desirable.  IF persons are unable to bind themselves to the general concepts that are emboided in these instruments, then do not get involved.  Persons who are known to have wilfully acted in a manner that has sought to commit wrongs such as those described by the notes on [[SocialAttackVectors]] may be subject to [[banishmentExile]] without notice and without further regard, irraspective of employer or any other factor that may otherwise discriminatorily fail to adhere to the foundational principals described in the instruments above.  \n\n#### Once webizen systems are operational.\n\n### Arbitration of conflicting values.\n\nThe arbitration of matters involving alledged wrongs will be processed in accordance with the [[WebizenTerms]] stipulations; until such time as [[TheWebizenCharter]] and corralated [[WebizenAlliance]] infrastructure is able to be established; which in-turn requires a functional [[WebizenTechStack]] implementation, which is the purposeful activity that gives rise to the purpose of having written this and other notes here. \n\n[[BestEfforts]] are to be undertaken at all times, however, all rights are reserved.\n\n`#socialfabric #ValuesFrameworks #SafetyProtocols`"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/AgentLabelling/AgentLabellingChatGPT/","title":"Agent Labelling"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"\n# Agent Labelling\n\nIt is important that there is a clear means to distinguish between the content, information or processes and decisions that are made by Software Agents (AI) Vs. those made by legal entities; and in-turn also, the ability to dertermine which specific human beings were involved in many or causing any sort of causality related action to occur.\n\nAsking ChatGPT;\n\nMy Question:\nWhat are the sorts of dangers, threats and social attack vectors that may occur if human beings are falsely led to believe they are consuming the work of other human beings or legal entities; when in-fact they're consuming information generated via an artificial intelligence software program?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n*There are several dangers and threats that may occur if individuals are falsely led to believe that they are consuming information generated by other human beings or legal entities when it is actually generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) program. Some of these include:*\n\n-   Misinformation and disinformation: AI-generated content can be used to spread false or misleading information, which can have negative effects on individuals and society at large.\n    \n-   Manipulation and influence: AI-generated content can be used to manipulate individuals and groups by appealing to their emotions, biases, and prejudices.\n    \n-   Privacy and security concerns: AI-generated content can be used to target individuals with personalized phishing, scams, and other malicious attacks.\n    \n-   Dehumanization and mistrust: People being exposed to AI generated content that is falsely presented as being generated by human could lead to mistrust in human-generated content, leading towards a dehumanization of human expression as well as a mistrust in human-generated content, AI-generated content can be used to perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce societal biases.\n    \n-   Interfere with legal process: AI-generated content can be used to impersonate people or entities for fraudulent activities or illegal activities and could interfere with legal proceedings.\n    \n\n*Overall, it is important for individuals to be able to distinguish between AI-generated content and human-generated content in order to make informed decisions and to protect themselves from potential dangers.*\n\n*Another potential danger of falsely believing that information is generated by human beings when it is actually generated by AI is that it may lead to a lack of critical thinking and evaluation of the information being consumed. If people believe that the information they are consuming is coming from a trusted source, they may be less likely to fact-check or critically evaluate it. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, as well as a decrease in people's ability to make well-informed decisions.*\n\n*Additionally, there may be ethical concerns associated with the use of AI-generated content, particularly when it is used to impersonate human beings or legal entities. The ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-generated content raises questions about consent and accountability, as well as potential harms that may be caused by the use of this technology.*\n\n*Finally, the widespread use of AI-generated content has the potential to disrupt various industries and change the way people think about and interact with information. It could change how professional authors, journalists, and creative professionals work, which could have both positive and negative impacts on the economy and society.*\n\nMy Question: \nWhat are some of the threats related to circumstances where government departments and/or employees may use Artificial Intelligence to act in a manner that has human rights implications in relation to the effect of those actions if it is not clearly labelled to have been done via an AI Agent?\n\n\nChatGPT Answer: \n\n*If government departments or employees use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a way that has human rights implications and it is not clearly labeled as having been done by an AI agent, there could be several threats. Some of these include:*\n\n-   *Discrimination and bias: If an AI system is not transparent in its decision-making processes, it may perpetuate discrimination and bias against certain individuals or groups, potentially violating their human rights.*\n    \n*-   Lack of accountability: If an AI system is used to make decisions or take actions that have human rights implications, it can be difficult to hold individuals or organizations accountable if the system is not clearly labeled as an AI agent and its decision-making process is opaque.*\n    \n-   *Due process concerns: If an AI system is used to make decisions that affect an individual's rights or freedoms, it may not always provide the same level of due process protections as a human decision-maker. This could lead to violations of human rights and the rule of law.*\n    \n-   *Privacy and security: If an AI system is used to process personal data without proper regulation or oversight, it could lead to privacy violations, security breaches, and other harms.*\n    \n-   *Lack of transparency: If the actions of an AI agent is not clearly labeled, it can make it difficult for people to understand how decisions are being made, which could lead to mistrust and lack of transparency.*\n    \n*-   Interference with human autonomy: If an AI agent make decisions that have significant impact on human life, people may lose their autonomy on the decision making process and their right to self-determination.*\n    \n\n*Overall, it is crucial that government departments and employees are transparent in their use of AI, clearly label any decisions or actions that are made by an AI agent, and ensure that the AI systems they use are fair, accountable, and respect human rights.*\n\n*Another potential threat is that the AI may have unintended consequences on human rights, if it not properly implemented, tested, and monitored. Even if the AI system is not inherently biased, the data it is trained on may be biased, leading to unjust outcomes.*\n\n*Additionally, if the use of AI is not transparent and the decision-making processes of the AI system are not explainable, it may be difficult for people to understand how the decisions are being made and to challenge them if they believe that their human rights are being violated.*\n\n*Moreover, if AI agents are used in law enforcement or security, without proper oversight or regulation, there could be a risk that the AI systems may be used to infringe on individuals’ rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, or to target certain groups based on their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs.*\n\n*It is important that the use of AI by government departments and employees is subject to proper regulation and oversight, so that human rights are protected and that the actions of the AI systems can be transparently tracked and audited.*\n\n*Finally, It is crucial that the AI system are continuously monitored and evaluated for their impacts on human rights and adjustments or replacements are made if necessary*.\n\nMy Question:\nwhat are some of the potential risks in circumstances relating to foreign governments? \n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nThere are several potential risks in circumstances related to foreign governments using AI:\n\n-   Cyber espionage: Foreign governments may use AI to conduct cyber espionage or cyberattacks against other countries, potentially stealing sensitive information or disrupting critical infrastructure.\n    \n-   Misinformation and disinformation: Foreign governments may use AI-generated content to spread false or misleading information, with the intention of manipulating public opinion or undermining the credibility of other governments.\n    \n-   Interference in domestic politics: Foreign governments may use AI to interfere in the domestic politics of other countries, with the goal of swaying elections or influencing policy decisions.\n    \n-   Economic espionage: Foreign governments may use AI to gain an unfair advantage in international trade, by collecting business intelligence and targeting specific industries or companies.\n    \n-   Military advantage: Foreign governments may use AI to enhance their military capabilities, potentially threatening the stability of regions and global security\n    \n-   Human Rights abuse: AI technology has been used by some governments to track and control their citizens, violating their privacy and freedom. This technology can also be used to identify and monitor individuals based on their ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs, leading to further human rights violations.\n    \n\nOverall, the use of AI by foreign governments has the potential to destabilize international relations and threaten the security and sovereignty of other countries. It is important for governments to be aware of these risks and to take steps to protect against them, through international cooperation, regulation, and diplomacy.\n\nAnother potential risk is that foreign governments may use AI in a way that violates international law or human rights. For example, they may use AI-enabled surveillance to target political opponents, or use autonomous weapons to target civilians in warfare. These actions can have significant negative consequences on human rights and global security.\n\nMoreover, the increasing use of AI in economic and technological fields may lead to a power imbalance between countries that have access to advanced AI technology and those that do not, leading to further economic and societal inequality.\n\nFurthermore, if AI is not controlled and regulated properly, foreign governments may use it to violate international norms, such as economic sanctions or arms control agreements.\n\nLastly, foreign governments may also use AI to target individuals, companies or countries with cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns for political, economic, or military gain.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial for countries to work together through international organizations and agreements to establish norms and regulations for the responsible development and use of AI, as well as to cooperate on matters of cyber security, disinformation, and human rights.\n\n\nMy Question:\n\nWhat are some of the ways AI content and/or software actions could be clearly labelled and associated with the legal entity involved and responsible for that AI content and/or software action, including both any legal personality (ie: government department, institution, corporation or business, ) as well as the specific natural legal entities / individuals (human beings) who were instrumentally involved in enabling or rendering the applied use of AI for the particular artifact or event?\n\nChatGPT Answer;\n\nThere are several ways that AI content and/or software actions can be clearly labeled and associated with the legal entity responsible for them, including both the legal personality (e.g. government department, institution, corporation or business) and the specific natural legal entities/individuals who were involved in enabling or using the AI for the particular artifact or event. Some of these methods include:\n\n-   Digital Signatures: Using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of AI content or software actions, and to link them to the legal entity or individual responsible for them.\n    \n-   Attribution Statements: Including an attribution statement in the AI content or software that identifies the legal entity or individual responsible for it.\n    \n-   Watermarking: Watermarking AI content or software with unique identifiers that can be used to trace it back to the legal entity or individual responsible for it.\n    \n-   Logging: Keeping detailed logs of who had access to and used the AI system, and what actions they took.\n    \n-   Transparency Reports: Publishing transparency reports that provide information on the legal entities and individuals involved in the development and use of AI, as well as the system's decision-making processes and any human rights considerations.\n    \n-   Certifications: Certifying the AI system by a third-party, that verifies that the system meets certain standards, such as fairness and transparency\n    \n-   Source codes or system architecture: Making the source codes or system architecture of AI systems available for public inspection, in order for third parties to verify how the systems make decisions.\n    \n-   Human oversight: Ensuring that AI systems are designed with human oversight and decision-making capabilities to make adjustments or corrections if necessary, and keeping records of those adjustments or corrections.\n    \n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that the AI system are clearly labeled and that the legal entity or individual responsible for the system is easily identifiable and can be held accountable for its actions. This can be achieved through a combination of technical and organizational measures, such as the ones listed above, which should be chosen according to the specific context and the potential impacts of the system.\n\nAnother way of clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them, is by using blockchain technology, it can enable the creation of an immutable and transparent record of the origin and usage of the AI content or software. This can enable users to verify the authenticity of the content and trace it back to the legal entity or individual that created it, providing a tamper-proof record of the development and usage of the AI system.\n\nAnother approach to clearly identify the responsible entity is by using standard data labels, like the \"metadata\" of digital files, AI artifacts should also have standard labels that clearly identify the legal entity or individual responsible for them, such as the developer, creator, owner, or operator.\n\nAdditionally, governments could also play a role in promoting transparency and accountability of AI systems by implementing regulations and guidelines on the labeling of AI content and software actions, and enforcing penalties for non-compliance.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that it is not just a technical problem but also a societal one, and that it requires a multi-stakeholder approach, which includes industry, civil society, and government, to develop a solution and to ensure that it is effectively implemented.\n\nAnother way of clearly labeling AI content and/or software actions is by using certification systems. These systems involve an independent third party, such as a regulatory agency or industry group, evaluating the AI system and verifying that it meets certain standards, such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. These certifications can be used to clearly label the AI system and to provide assurance to users that the system has been independently reviewed and found to be trustworthy.\n\nAnother way of clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions is by using explainable AI (XAI) techniques, these techniques allow the AI system to explain its decision-making process to users in a way that is easy for humans to understand. This can help users to trust the system and to understand how it makes decisions, and also make it easier for legal entities or individuals to be held accountable for the actions of the system.\n\nFinally, it is important to educate the public about the importance of clearly labeling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them. This can help to increase awareness of the risks associated with AI and to promote responsible use of the technology.\n\nIn summary, there are many methods for clearly labelling AI content and/or software actions and associating them with the legal entity responsible for them, such as digital signatures, attribution statements, watermarking, logging, transparency reports, certifications, blockchain, standard data labels, explainable AI (XAI) and education. These methods can be used in combination to provide a comprehensive approach to transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\nMy Question:\nHow might an ontology using RDF and common vocabularies be defined to provide a means to deploy these sorts of solutions? Can you give me an example of an RDF OWL ontology?\n\nAn ontology using RDF and common vocabularies can provide a structured way to describe and represent information related to the legal entity responsible for AI content and/or software actions, as well as the actions themselves. RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a standard for modeling information on the web, and it provides a way to express the relationships between resources (e.g. documents, people, and concepts) using a graph-based structure.\n\nA simple example of an RDF OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology for describing AI content and software actions could include classes such as \"AI system\", \"Legal entity\", \"Individual\", \"Action\", and \"Responsibility\". Each class would have a set of properties that describe their characteristics and relationships, such as \"name\", \"developer\", \"owner\", \"operator\", \"decision-making process\" and \"Standards met\", respectively.\n\nFor example, the class \"AI system\" could have properties such as \"name\", \"developer\", \"owner\", \"operator\" and \"decision-making process\". The class \"Legal entity\" would have properties such as \"name\", \"type\" (e.g. government department, institution, corporation or business), \"location\", and \"jurisdiction\". The class \"Individual\" would have properties such as \"name\" and \"role\" (e.g. developer, owner, operator). The class \"Action\" would have properties such as \"name\", \"date\", \"type\" (e.g. decision, action) and \"outcome\". The class \"Responsibility\" would have properties such as \"level\" (e.g. primary, secondary, etc) and \"entity\" (e.g. legal entity, individual)\n\nThese classes and properties can be interconnected to describe complex relationships between AI systems, legal entities, individuals, and actions, and can be used to trace the origin and usage of AI content and software actions, and to establish accountability and transparency. The use of common vocabularies, such as schema.org and others, would help to standardize the representation of the information and make it more easily understandable and usable by different systems and applications.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is just a simple example and that a more comprehensive ontology would be more complex and take into account the specific context and use case. And that, the use of RDF and OWL enables the use of formal reasoning to infer new information from the ontology, which is particularly useful for the transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\nAdditionally, using RDF and OWL to represent an ontology can enable the use of formal reasoning to infer new information from the ontology, this is particularly useful for transparency and accountability of AI systems. For example, by creating inferences rules in the ontology, you can automatically infer information about the legal entities, individuals and actions responsible for an AI system, based on the properties of the AI system.\n\nMoreover, using RDF and OWL in this context can also enable the integration of the ontology with other systems, such as databases, document management systems and even other AI systems. This is particularly useful for creating transparency and accountability solutions, where information about AI systems, legal entities and individuals need to be shared and combined across different systems.\n\nAnother advantage of using RDF and OWL is that they can leverage the Linked Data ecosystem, which allows for easy data sharing and integration across different organizations and domains. This allows for more collaboration between different stakeholders, like industry, civil society and government, to help ensure the transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that creating an ontology is just a first step, the ontology itself should be continuously updated, maintained, and evaluated to make sure it is still useful and useful, to address the complexity and dynamic nature of the field of AI.\n\nMy Question:\n\ncan you write an example in notation3 syntax.\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nSure, here is an example of an RDF ontology written in Notation3 (N3) syntax to describe an AI system and its responsible legal entities and individuals:\n\n``` \n@prefix ai: <http://example.com/ontology/ai#> .\n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix org: <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#> .\n\nai:MyAI a ai:AI;\n    ai:name \"My AI System\";\n    ai:developer [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"John Doe\" ];\n    ai:owner [ a org:Organization; org:name \"Acme Inc.\" ];\n    ai:operator [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"Jane Smith\" ];\n    ai:decision-makingProcess \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\" .\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the ontology defines a class \"AI\" (ai:AI) and an instance of that class \"MyAI\" (ai:MyAI), it also specifies that \"MyAI\" has a name \"My AI System\", a developer \"John Doe\" (foaf:Person), an owner \"Acme Inc.\" (org:Organization), an operator \"Jane Smith\" (foaf:Person) and a decision-making process \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\"\n\nThis ontology uses prefixes to simplify the URIs (ai:, foaf:, org:) used in the statements. The prefixes indicate that the URIs in the ontology are from the given namespace, so \"ai:AI\" refers to the URI \"[http://example.com/ontology/ai#AI](http://example.com/ontology/ai#AI)\".\n\nNote that this is a simplified example, in real-world scenarios, the ontology would likely have more classes and properties and also, would relate to other ontologies to provide more context and meaning, such as time, location, standards met, etc.\n\nAdditionally, the ontology can include more classes and properties such as \"Action\", \"Responsibility\", \"Jurisdiction\", \"Location\", \"Date\", \"Standards\", \"Certification\" and \"TransparencyReports\" that describe the actions taken by the AI system, the level of responsibility of the legal entities and individuals, the jurisdiction, location, date of action, standards met, certifications achieved and transparency reports respectively.\n\nHere's an example of how these classes and properties can be added to the ontology:\n\n```\n@prefix ai: <http://example.com/ontology/ai#> .\n@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n@prefix org: <http://www.w3.org/ns/org#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n\nai:MyAI a ai:AI;\n    ai:name \"My AI System\";\n    ai:developer [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"John Doe\" ];\n    ai:owner [ a org:Organization; org:name \"Acme Inc.\" ];\n    ai:operator [ a foaf:Person; foaf:name \"Jane Smith\" ];\n    ai:decision-makingProcess \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\" ;\n    ai:performedAction [ a ai:Action; ai:name \"Decision Making\";\n    ai:outcome \"Approve the loan\";\n    ai:date \"2022-01-12T10:30:00Z\"^^xsd:dateTime];\n    ai:responsibility [ a ai:Responsibility;\n    ai:level \"Primary\";\n    ai:entity [a org:Organization; org:name \"Acme Inc.\" ]];\n    ai:jurisdiction \"US\";\n    ai:location \"New York\";\n    ai:standardsMet \"ISO/IEC 27001:2013\";\n    ai:certifications \"ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified\";\n    ai:transparencyReports <http://example.com/reports/myaisystem> .\n\n```\n\n\nThis enhanced example illustrates how more information can be added to the ontology, such as the actions taken by the AI system, the outcome, the date of the action, the level of responsibility of the legal entities and individuals, the jurisdiction, location, the standards met, certifications achieved, and transparency reports.\n\nIt is worth noting that the example provided is not intended to be a complete or perfect ontology but is meant to give an idea of how RDF and OWL can be used to represent an ontology that would help with transparency and accountability of AI systems.\n\n\nMy Question:\n\ncan you provide a more comprehensive example in json-ld?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nSure, here is a more comprehensive example of an RDF ontology written in JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) syntax to describe an AI system and its responsible legal entities and individuals:\n\n```json\n\n{\n\n    \"@context\": {\n\n        \"rdf\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\",\n        \"rdfs\": \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\",\n        \"xsd\": \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\",\n        \"foaf\": \"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\",\n        \"org\": \"http://www.w3.org/ns/org#\",\n        \"ai\": \"http://example.com/ontology/ai#\",\n        \"name\": \"ai:name\",\n        \"developer\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:developer\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n        \"owner\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:owner\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n\n        \"operator\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:operator\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n\n        \"decision-makingProcess\": \"ai:decision-makingProcess\",\n        \"performedAction\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:performedAction\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n\n        \"outcome\": \"ai:outcome\",\n        \"date\": \"ai:date\",\n        \"responsibility\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:responsibility\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n\n        \"level\": \"ai:level\",\n        \"entity\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:entity\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        },\n\n        \"jurisdiction\": \"ai:jurisdiction\",\n        \"location\": \"ai:location\",\n        \"standardsMet\": \"ai:standardsMet\",\n        \"certifications\": \"ai:certifications\",\n        \"transparencyReports\": {\n            \"@id\": \"ai:transparencyReports\",\n            \"@type\": \"@id\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"@id\": \"ai:MyAI\",\n    \"@type\": \"ai:AI\",\n    \"name\": \"My AI System\",\n    \"developer\": {\n        \"@id\": \"foaf:JohnDoe\",\n        \"@type\": \"foaf:Person\",\n        \"name\": \"John Doe\"\n    },\n\n    \"owner\": {\n        \"@id\": \"org:AcmeInc\",\n        \"@type\": \"org:Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Acme Inc.\"\n    },\n\n    \"operator\": {\n        \"@id\": \"foaf:JaneSmith\",\n        \"@type\": \"foaf:Person\",\n        \"name\": \"Jane Smith\"\n    },\n\n    \"decision-makingProcess\": \"Explainable AI using Decision Trees\",\n    \"performedAction\": {\n        \"@id\": \"ai:Action1\",\n        \"@type\": \"ai:Action\",\n        \"name\": \"Decision Making\",\n        \"outcome\": \"Approve the loan\",\n        \"date\": \"2022-01-12T10:30:00Z\"\n    },\n\n    \"responsibility\": {\n        \"@id\": \"ai:responsibility1\",\n        \"@type\": \"ai:Responsibility\",\n        \"level\": \"Primary\",\n        \"entity\": {\n            \"@id\": \"org:AcmeInc\",\n            \"@type\": \"org:Organization\",\n            \"name\": \"Acme Inc.\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"jurisdiction\": \"US\",\n    \"location\": \"New York\",\n    \"standardsMet\": \"ISO/IEC 27001:2013\",\n    \"certifications\": \"ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified\",\n    \"transparencyReports\": \"http://example.com/reports/myaisystem\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ontology defines several classes, such as \"AI\" (ai:AI), \"Action\" (ai:Action), \"Responsibility\" (ai:Responsibility), \"Person\" (foaf:Person), and \"Organization\" (org:Organization), it also specifies that \"MyAI\" has a name, developer, owner, operator, decision-making process, performed actions, outcome, date, level of responsibility, and jurisdiction, location, standards met, certifications and transparency reports. \n\nThe context provided, maps the prefixes used in the ontology to the corresponding URIs, as well as provides data types and relationships between the different classes and properties. This is used to make the JSON-LD data more easily readable for both machines and humans. As before, it's important to note that this is just an example and that the ontology can be much more detailed, depending on the complexity and dynamic nature of the field of AI.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhilst the specific approach certainly requires a great deal more work and consideration, the merit of the underlying notion appears to be considered important even by ChatGPT.  \n\nI hope this explains enough of this underlying consideration as is sought to be sufficiently illustrated, as to be added to the ToDo list for informatics policies relating to the development of webizen systems.\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/AgentLabelling/AgentLabellingProjectInit/","title":"Starting the Agent Labelling Project."},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Starting the Agent Labelling Project.\n\nAn expression of interest is now issued for people who are interested in contributing towards the development of the Agent Labelling Standards, protocols, Recommendations and the production of creative works that are usefully employed to both support the deliver of usefully positive solutions to these problems whilst ensuring support for [[ValuesCredentials]] virtues and related considerations.\n\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/AgentLabelling/ArtificialMinds/","title":"Artificial Minds"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Artificial Minds\n\n## Introduction\nThe somewhat social concept of how one might think about Artificial Intelligent agents and in-turn systems, like OpenAI and in-turn also 'webizen', is that they're a form of artificial mind.  These Artificial Minds, are not human, they're not an extension of a human, but rather they're a different sort of 'thing', that has different characteristics, qualities, capabilities & flaws.  The [[TheArtificialMindsIndex]] seeks to provide inspiration, to consider what sorts of characteristics it is that you want to be part of your AI related works - how is it you want your Webizen to function?  what should it be able to do?  what features shoud it have? what sorts of [[SafetyProtocols]] are important?

Therein - These works are not sought to be employed to deploy AI Agents that act in a [[NobodyAI]] like manner / methodology; and particular protections are sought to be forged in-order to ensure that my works are not employed for those purposes.  \n\nThese objectives form constituencies to the requirements for [[EndingDigitalSlavery]].\n\n### Further Notes about Webizen\n\nHistorical works sought to produce what i called a 'knowledge banking' ecosystem methodology; which was dependant upon the useful employment of what was in-effect a belief - that organisations would want to usefully support human agency and support the fundamental requirements necessary, in-order to do so; and in-turn, gainfully benefit via the operation of infrastructure that supported those requirements.  Yet, this isn't what happened.\n\nThe commercial deployment of works, particularly those around 'Digital Identity' specifically excluded support for; what is essentially about -human right, even though, the consequence of doing so engendered what is in-effect a choice to institutionally support  [[SocialAttackVectors]].   Within these systems the 'agent' was intended to support the requirements for, what is now being illustrated as [[HumanCentricOntology]].\n\nMore information about these former 'designs' is illustrated in documents like [[TheSemanticInforg&TheHumanCentricWeb — RealityCheckTech]] that have been copied into this documetation repo.  \n\nSO, whilst motified; and subject to on-going harms by people who - i consider simply, to be bad people - i went about trying to figure out how to define this ontology, which involved engaging in debate about it with leading minds world-wide via forum focused on the science of consciousness and all sorts of weird and wonderful advanced concepts therein.  This then led to debates about issues that limited the means to form productive works in the field.\n\nAs is required to support [[FreedomOfThought]] and [[HumanCentricAI]], etc.  which in-turn led to an epiphany; which was, that the issues with `owl:thing` goes away to some-degree, if the mission is to produce a method whereby persons are made able to 'buy' (and own) their own 'robots' (ai).  By shifting from the impossible situation of having to contend with well funded adverseries who had absolutely no interest whatsoever in [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] (indeed, arguably they're seeking the opposite - whilst simultaniously seeking others to believe that they're doing so, gainfully, only because of other people); away from a persons 'digital twin', or the digital emboidment of a persons existance and all related records; towards an alternative, that was about how we define an 'ai agent' that is an emboidment of what we want to have, own and 'interact' with our lives, the situation pivoted in a fairly remarkable way.  This then led to my realisation, that this is what i needed to do with the old term 'webizen' that i had formerally used, and consequentially 'saved' webizen.org to do something good with in future.   \n\nIn the end; the Webizen, is the artificial intelligence agent that is designed to support the needs of its owner; and if the owner is a legal entity (ie: company, etc. group entity); then it must interact with other webizen, that are owned by the individuals (human beings) these systems (tools) are intended to support; as the conduit of responsibility for our biosphere.\n\nIn-order to make these 'robots' work; there needs to be a method to define 'core logic' and related systems requirements.  The development of Cognative AI ecosystem components is critical to the realisation of those goals.   \n\nWhilst Human Beings naturally develop a comprehension about many things; including natural language,\n\nRobots (software) is able to develop comprehension about many computational things.  \n\n![[differences.jpeg]]\n\nThe objective is to seek to produce personal and private AI Agents (webizen) that are equipped to support doing the tasks, that human beings are not best equipped to do. \n\nIn-effect, its a long-way down the track from the time where electronic caculators were introduced and made usable by students in schools, etc.  \n\n![[nocloud.jpg]]\n\nYet presently, the use of advanced AI generally requires interactions to be performed via 3rd party systems that are - somewhat 'global' in nature; fundamentally, these systems are not 'private' and there's an array of implications that is likely to lead some people towards seeking an alternative.  As part of these systems, seeking to provide an alternative, there needs to be some processing of complex logic in-order to support most linked requirements.\n\n## Description of CogAI \n\nCognitive artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that is designed to mimic the cognitive abilities of humans, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing. It is based on the idea that the human brain is a computational system that can be emulated by a machine, and it seeks to build AI systems that can perform tasks that require human-like cognition.\n\nCognitive AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision, which allow machines to learn from data, understand and generate human language, and perceive and understand the visual world in a way that is similar to humans. These technologies can be applied in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, education, and customer service, to assist humans in making decisions, providing personalized recommendations, and completing tasks more efficiently.\n\nHowever, cognitive AI also raises ethical and societal concerns, such as the potential for automation to displace human workers, the need for transparency and explainability in AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to perpetuate and amplify biases present in the data used to train it. As a result, the development and use of cognitive AI requires careful consideration of these issues and the responsible design and deployment of these technologies.\n\n### UseCases\n\nSome of the initial use-cases for CogAI will include the [[TheValuesProject]] and in-turn therein,  the ability to process a multitude of [[ValuesCredentials]] and in-turn provide support for Webizen Owners to evaluate whether and/or how an activity may be compliant, compatible and/or promotional of those values or whether and how there may be some sort of conflict.  \n\n### Requirements\n\nThere must be an open-standards way to perform these sorts of procedural knowledge representation tasks.  This will in-turn support productivity and reduce and/or clarify risks associated with behaviours and/or activities.\n\nThe Area has an array of very complex requirements; however fundamentally, the Web Science related requirement, is to figure out how to form a #HumanCentric Approach; so that, whilst the tools may offer suggestions and/or support, it is fundamentally still only humans that are responsible for making decisions and not Active Artificial Agents ( #AI )\n\n### W3C Cognative AI CG \n\nWork to produce an open-standard for Cognative AI is being undertaken now in the [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\n\"The real world is frustratingly uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent. This is challenging for traditional approaches to information systems, and a new paradigm is needed that combines symbolic and statistical techniques, building upon decades of work in the cognitive sciences, and over 500 million years of natural selection. This will allow us to create cognitive agents that learn and reason based upon prior knowledge and past experience, and which can satisfy the need for, transparency in decision making, and continuous learning for adapting to ever changing needs. This community group will address opportunities for cognitive agents using graphs, statistics, rules and graph algorithms, starting with an amalgam of RDF and Property Graphs, together with Web architecture for cognitive databases.\"\n\nSource:  [W3C CogAI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/cogai/) \n\nNote also the GitHub link for the [CogAI](https://github.com/w3c/cogai/).\n\n## CogAI as a toolchain for Cognitive Databases\n\n### What are Cognative Databases?\n\n**Description by ChatGPT**\nA cognitive database is a type of database that can understand natural language queries and extract meaning from unstructured data. It uses techniques from artificial intelligence and natural language processing to analyze and understand the data stored within the database, making it more easily accessible to users. This allows for more efficient and accurate data retrieval, as well as the ability to perform more complex queries and analysis.\n\nCognitive databases can also learn and adapt over time, by analyzing user interactions and feedback to improve the accuracy of its analysis and responses. Additionally, they can provide insights and recommendations based on the data they have analyzed, and can even generate natural language responses to user queries.\n\nCognitive databases are increasingly being used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance, and retail, to help organizations better understand and make use of the large amounts of data they collect. They can also be used to improve customer service by allowing customers to interact with the database using natural language, rather than having to learn a specific query language.\n\nIt's important to note that cognitive databases are still relatively new and there is ongoing research to improve their capabilities and make them more widely adopted.\n\nMy Question: What is the datastructure for a cognative database?\n\nThe data structure for a cognitive database can vary depending on the specific implementation and the type of data being stored. However, some common elements include:\n\n1.  A structured data layer: This layer typically stores structured data in tables or columns, similar to a traditional relational database.\n    \n2.  An unstructured data layer: This layer is used to store unstructured data such as text, images, and audio. It can be stored in various forms such as raw text, XML, JSON and etc.\n    \n3.  A semantic layer: This layer is used to extract meaning from the unstructured data and provide a way to query it using natural language.\n    \n4.  A machine learning layer: This layer can be used to train machine learning models to understand the data and improve the accuracy of the database's analysis and responses.\n    \n5.  A knowledge graph: This layer is used to store the relationships between data entities and make it easy to traverse the data.\n    \n6.  A natural language processing (NLP) layer: This layer is used to analyze and understand natural language text, such as that found in user queries or unstructured data. It can be used to extract entities, sentiment, and intent from text and make it more easily searchable and understandable.\n    \n7.  A reasoning layer: This layer can be used to reason over the data and make inferences based on it. It can help the database understand the context of a query and provide more accurate responses.\n    \n8.  An ontology layer: This layer can be used to represent the concepts and relationships in the data using a formal ontology. This can be used to help the database understand the meaning of the data and make it more easily searchable.\n    \n9.  A visualization layer: This layer can be used to display the data in a meaningful way, such as through charts, graphs, or maps. This can make it easier for users to understand and interact with the data.\n    \n\nIt's important to note that the specific data structure of a cognitive database will depend on the particular implementation and the use case. The key feature is that it can understand and extract meaning from unstructured data, making it more easily accessible to users.\n\nIt's worth noting that not all cognitive databases will include all of these elements and the specific data structure may vary depending on the application and the specific use case.\n\nNOTES:\n\nBelow are notes that are relevant for the work described in the [[PCTOntologyModelling]] page (currently) about how to form a method for top-level ontological structures.  \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/CognitiveAI/DefeasibleLogic/","title":"Defeasible Logic"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Defeasible Logic\n\nNOTES:  \nDefeasible logic, originally created by Donald Nute with a particular concern about efficiency and implementation, is a simple and efficient rule based non-monotonic formalism.

In-order to provide some background resources are provided via the [GitHub link for this CG](https://github.com/w3c/cogai#positioning-relative-to-existing-approaches-to-ai).  In-order to get a more generic summary, i've queried ChatGPT.\n\n### ChatGPT Notes\n\nMy Question: Define Plausible Reasoning as it relates to Cognative AI Agents?\n\n***ChatGPT Answer:***\n\nPlausible reasoning refers to the ability of a cognitive AI agent to generate reasonable and likely explanations for a given situation or problem, based on the information and knowledge it has been trained on. It involves understanding the context of a problem and applying relevant knowledge and reasoning techniques to generate a plausible solution or explanation. This type of reasoning is important in tasks such as natural language understanding, decision making, and problem solving.\n\nPlausible reasoning is a form of probabilistic reasoning, which means that the AI agent considers multiple possible explanations and assigns a probability to each one based on the available evidence. This allows the agent to deal with uncertainty and make decisions based on the best available information.\n\nIn natural language understanding, for example, a cognitive AI agent with plausible reasoning capabilities would be able to understand the meaning of a sentence, even if it contains ambiguities or missing information. It would generate multiple possible interpretations of the sentence and choose the most likely one based on the context and the available knowledge.\n\nIn decision making, a cognitive AI agent with plausible reasoning capabilities would be able to make informed decisions, even in situations where the available information is incomplete or uncertain. It would consider multiple possible outcomes and choose the one that is most likely to achieve the desired goal.\n\nIn summary, plausible reasoning allows cognitive AI agents to generate reasonable and likely explanations or solutions based on incomplete or uncertain information. It is an important aspect of artificial intelligence research and is crucial for building intelligent agents that can operate in real-world environments.\n\n***My Question:***\n\nwhat fields of mathematics are used to design cognitive AI Plausible Reasoning software systems that are designed to work with Semtantic Web technologies such as RDF and RDFS, etc.\n\n***ChatGPT Answer:***\n\nCognitive AI systems that are designed to work with semantic web technologies such as RDF and RDFS typically use a combination of mathematical techniques from several fields, including:\n\n1.  Graph theory: RDF and RDFS use a graph-based data model, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between entities. Graph theory is used to analyze and manipulate the structure of these graphs.\n    \n2.  Logic: Logical reasoning is used to make inferences about the relationships between entities in the RDF graph. Description Logic (DL) is a subset of First-order Logic (FOL) that is often used for this purpose.\n    \n3.  Probability and statistics: Plausible reasoning in AI systems often involve probability and statistics, as the agent must assign probabilities to different possible outcomes or explanations. Bayesian networks, Markov decision process and Gaussian Process are few examples that are used in this area.\n    \n4.  Machine learning: Machine learning techniques are used to train the AI system to make predictions or inferences based on the RDF data. This could be supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning depending on the problem at hand.\n    \n5.  Optimization: Optimization algorithms are used to find the best possible solution to a problem, given a set of constraints. Linear programming, convex optimization and other optimization techniques are used in AI systems.\n    \n6.  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Many semantic web applications involve natural language text, and NLP techniques are used to extract meaning from the text and relate it to entities in the RDF graph. This may include techniques such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis.\n    \n7.  Information retrieval: Information retrieval techniques are used to search and retrieve relevant information from the RDF graph. This may include techniques such as keyword-based search, semantic search, and graph-based search.\n    \n8.  Knowledge representation: Techniques such as ontologies and conceptual modeling are used to represent knowledge in a structured and formal way, making it easier for the AI system to understand and reason about the data.\n    \n9.  Distributed Systems: Some semantic web applications involve distributed data, and distributed systems techniques are used to manage and coordinate access to the data.\n    \n10.  Cyber Security: As with any system that handle sensitive data, security is of prime importance.

It is typically non-routine and requires a high level of education, training, or experience. Examples of knowledge work include research, consulting, analysis, design, and development. This type of work is often associated with information-intensive industries such as finance, technology, and education. It is typically done by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and scientists, and requires the ability to think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions.\n\nThe creation of software for the support of socio-economic ecosystems that act to preserve human rights, support the needs of workers, and protect against exploitation and other harms can be considered a form of knowledge work. This type of software development involves the use of specialized knowledge and expertise to design, develop, and maintain software systems that support these important social and economic goals.\n\nSoftware developers engaged in this type of work may be involved in the creation of systems that help to monitor and protect the rights of workers, such as by tracking working hours and ensuring fair pay. They may also work on software that helps to prevent exploitation and other forms of abuse, such as by providing tools for reporting and tracking incidents.\n\nIn addition to technical skills, knowledge work in this context may also require a deep understanding of social and economic issues, as well as a commitment to promoting and upholding human rights. The development of software to support socio-economic ecosystems requires a high level of creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking in order to create effective and sustainable solutions to complex challenges.\n\nPhilosophy, web science, and economics can all play important roles in the production of software designed to support knowledge workers.\n\nPhilosophy can help to inform the ethical and moral principles that guide the design and development of software for knowledge work. For example, the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability may be central to the development of software that supports knowledge workers, and these principles may be grounded in philosophical theories of justice or moral reasoning.\n\nWeb science, which is the study of the structure, evolution, and use of the World Wide Web, can also be important for the production of software for knowledge work. Web science can provide insights into how people use and interact with software, as well as how to design software that is user-friendly and effective.\n\nEconomics, meanwhile, can help to inform the business and financial aspects of software development for knowledge work. This may include considerations such as the cost of development, pricing models, and the potential return on investment. Economics can also help to analyze the potential economic impacts of software for knowledge work, such as its effects on productivity and efficiency.\n\nIn relation to the activity of performing knowledge work; the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can be significantly longer than the time it takes to actually create the artifact. This is because knowledge work often involves complex, non-routine tasks that require a high level of education, training, or experience.\n\nFor example, the process of designing a concept for a web application may involve a significant amount of time spent researching and analyzing user needs, studying existing solutions, and conceptualizing and prototyping different design approaches. This process of understanding and planning can take weeks, months, or even years, depending on the complexity of the project.\n\nOn the other hand, the process of implementing the web application solution as software may involve a shorter amount of time, as it involves following a detailed plan or set of instructions to build the actual software. This implementation phase may still require a high level of skill and expertise, but it typically relies on a foundation of understanding and planning that has already been established.\n\nOverall, the amount of time it takes to comprehend and form the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to create a derivative artifact can vary greatly depending on the complexity and scope of the project. However, in general, this process of comprehension and understanding can take significantly longer than the actual process of creating the artifact.\n\nHistorically, \n\nThere are several economic methodologies that were able to be used to compensate individuals who have produced valuable works through knowledge work, even if they were not paid for their work while it was being produced. \n\nSome of those potential options included:\n\n1.  Royalties: A royalty is a payment made to the creator of a work based on the number of copies sold or the amount of revenue generated by the work. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the value that their work generates over time.\n    \n2.  Licensing: A licensing agreement allows the creator of a work to grant permission to others to use the work in exchange for a fee. This model can be used to ensure that creators are compensated for the use of their work, even if they are not directly involved in the distribution or sale of the work.\n    \n3.  Equity: In some cases, creators may be able to negotiate for an ownership stake in the company or venture that is using their work. This can provide them with a share of the profits or value generated by the work.\n    \n4.  Crowdfunding: Crowdfunding platforms allow creators to seek financial support from a large number of people, typically through small contributions. This model can be used to raise funds for the production of a work, and can also help to build a community of supporters around the work.\n    \n\n### Relationship between Fair Terms and Taxation\nIf knowledge workers are unpaid or solely funded via universal basic income (UBI), it is likely to have an impact on taxation income. UBI is a form of social security that provides a guaranteed income to all citizens, regardless of their employment status or income level.\n\nIf knowledge workers are receiving UBI as their primary source of income, it is likely that they will not be paying taxes on their income, as UBI is typically designed to be tax-free. This could reduce the overall amount of taxation income collected by the government.\n\nOn the other hand, if knowledge workers are not being paid for their work at all, it is possible that they may be reliant on other forms of government assistance, such as welfare payments or unemployment benefits. In this case, the government may still be incurring costs to support these individuals, even if they are not generating taxation income through their work.\n\nOverall, the impact of unpaid or UBI-funded knowledge workers on taxation income will depend on the specific details of the UBI program and the broader economic context.\n\n### Relationship between Economics and Intellectual Property\nIf knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are not compensated or acknowledged for their contributions towards works that are later commercially exploited by others without lawful licensing rights, it can have a number of negative impacts on intellectual property rights.\n\nFirst and foremost, it can undermine the principle of fair compensation for intellectual property, which is a key aspect of intellectual property law. If knowledge workers are not being fairly compensated for their contributions, it can discourage them from continuing to create and innovate, which can have a negative impact on the overall development and growth of the field.\n\nIn addition, the unauthorized exploitation of intellectual property can also lead to disputes and legal conflicts. If knowledge workers are not properly compensated or credited for their work, they may seek legal remedies to protect their rights and seek fair compensation. This can result in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings, which can be disruptive to businesses and industries that rely on the exploitation of intellectual property.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers who produce valuable intellectual property are fairly compensated and acknowledged for their contributions. This can help to promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem, which is essential for fostering innovation and economic growth.\n\nIn general, it is not lawful to obtain intellectual property from a knowledge worker if they are not compensated for their work. Intellectual property law provides legal protections for the creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. These protections typically include the right to be compensated for the use of the intellectual property.\n\nIf a knowledge worker creates a work that is protected by intellectual property law, they have the right to be compensated for its use. This may include payment for the use of the work, or an agreement to share in the profits generated by the work. Without such an agreement, it is typically not lawful to use the work without the knowledge worker's consent.\n\nThere are some limited exceptions to this rule, such as the \"fair use\" doctrine in copyright law, which allows for limited use of copyrighted works without permission in certain circumstances, such as for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, these exceptions are typically narrow and do not allow for the unrestricted use of intellectual property without compensation.\n\nOverall, it is important to ensure that knowledge workers are fairly compensated for their valuable intellectual property in order to respect their rights and promote a healthy and vibrant intellectual property ecosystem.\n\nThrough the development of the [[WorkProject]] new solutions become available.

This could include rates of return in the range of 10-20% or higher.*\n\n*However, it is important to note that these rates are only estimates, and the actual rate of return that an investor or lender is seeking may vary significantly based on the specific details of the project and the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives. It is also worth noting that the rate of return sought by an investor or lender may not necessarily reflect the rate of return that the project is able to generate.*\n\n*Overall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking funding for early stage projects to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any unsecured loans they are considering, including the rate of return being sought by the investor or lender.*\n\nQ: What is the typical return on investment expectation for Early Stage Venture Capital?\n\nA: *The typical return on investment (ROI) expectation for early stage venture capital can vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the stage of the company, the industry sector, and the specific investment strategy of the venture capital firm.*\n\n*In general, venture capital firms that invest in early stage companies are typically seeking higher rates of return to compensate for the higher level of risk involved. According to some estimates, venture capital firms may typically aim for an ROI of 3-5 times their initial investment over a period of 5-7 years.*\n\n*However, it is important to note that these are only estimates, and the actual ROI achieved by a venture capital firm may vary significantly based on the specific details of the investment. Venture capital investing is generally considered to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition, and it is not uncommon for some investments to fail to deliver any return, while others may achieve significantly higher returns.*\n\n*Overall, it is important for entrepreneurs seeking venture capital funding to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any investment offer, including the expected ROI and the time frame in which the venture capital firm expects to see a return on its investment.*\n\n**Q:**  What would be the fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture was capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage, for an early stage project?\n\nA: *The fixed rate of return if the compensatory amount for a successful venture is capped to a specified fixed multiplier or percentage for an early stage project would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the investment.*\n\n*For example, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed multiplier of 2x the initial investment, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be 100% (2x the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.*\n\n*On the other hand, if the compensatory amount is capped at a fixed percentage of the initial investment, such as 50%, and the initial investment is $100,000, the fixed rate of return would be $50,000 (50% of the initial investment), assuming that the project is successful and the cap is reached.*\n\n*It is important to note that fixed multipliers and percentages can be used in a variety of different investment structures, and the specific terms and conditions of an investment will vary depending on the specific details of the project and the preferences of the investor. It is up to the investor to carefully consider the terms and conditions of the investment, including any caps on the compensatory amount, before making a decision.* \n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/WorkProject/Resources/","title":"Resources"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Resources are any materials, assets, or inputs that are used to produce goods or services.

All of them contribute to collaboration in seeking to produce information systems designed to support fairness via reward systems in a decentralized way, by providing a commons friendly ways of accounting. \n\nThese solutions seek to define value flows which then can be placed in a ledger, collective intelligence system or spreadsheet for contributive accounting, open value accounting and collaborative accounting. \n\n#### Aim of the document \n\nThis document aims to harvest the IT solutions found and practical tools used. It does not broadly expand to the organizational models behind them. However via the links and in the demonstrative images some of that becomes visible too.\n\nTiberius Brastaviceanu (founder Sensorica) justly said: “An organisation is a living system. One cannot just talk about an IT-infrastructure. Tools are only one aspect of an organisation, and their nature depends on the nature of the organisation.”\n\nThe underlying document is meant to demonstrate what is being developed in the p2p world until now and creates a foundation for us to create a knowledge banking methodology and organizational structure. As we hoped to be able to do accounting while we work towards this structure on the basis of this foundation, we are not sure yet that this is possible. So this is a temporary basis for which we wanted to investigate existing initiatives and practical solutions.\n\n## What are we looking for?\n\nWhat we are looking for is: existing methods of open value or contribution accounting for teams of freelancers / startups / scale ups that have been used till now. Favorably with a link to tax requirements, billing, transparent transaction, value flows and open value systems.\n\nWelcoming also analysis on the difficulties in collaborative accounting / group accounting / the shift to working in groups rather than as individuals and how this relates to present day tax systems / accounting systems and the embedding of new collaboration rules in tooling / technology.\n\nI.e. blockchain is and was promising to create something like measurable value and reputation, yet it is detached from the ordinary rules of accounting, so hard to have a one click go for billing / transaction of tokens / coins / (money). Creating economical space for renewal is wonderful, but how does it translate to the ordinary requirements? If there is an accounting system that already does that translation: from individualized work / corporate work structures to collaborative open value accounting: what were the pitfalls? Are there open ends? Are there specific learnings in that trajectory and questions to be answered still?\n\n### Solutions available in the marketplace\n\nThe below examples illustrate an array of projects that are working towards a similar goal. \n\nInstructions: please feel welcome to add other solutions in-line as a contribution (suggestion) or as a comment - for us to find and review.\n\nSolutions are of a different nature: from spreadsheets or working tools for money allocation and evaluation and management of hours and tasks / roles to blockchain solutions and open value accounting to transformative models for a new economy. Some working, some in development. \n\n### [OuiShare](https://www.ouishare.net/)\n\nOuiShare operated before blockchain was available in spreadsheets exercising the idea of blockchain and open value accounting / having a basic income idea of spreading money over projects in ordinary spreadsheets. Prognosing the outcome of efforts and the distribution of money as well as collaboratively evaluating efforts and money streams.\n\n\nOld: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ryGNj-bqpMDW06xE0L3eo4QeFKgbF-8DnnxUdRe9xE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nNew:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GWeOGKTEN6iaBxr92_H3h2797zCzgTs0JoIx5kPENs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nBasic income try out with project budgets (50% of OuiShare’s then annual budget available for non solid issues):\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QNxnd9fM_rYtfN1rgiYVbcl_PjW1Mu8SkzU_KQY8IK8/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n### [Cobudget](https://cobudget.co/) (also used by Enspiral)\n\nCurrently OuiShare and Enspiral use Cobudget as a tool to manage money. Cobudget is a tool and a methodology that makes resource allocation participatory. It enables all members of an organization to get involved in decision-making by proposing projects and allocating funds to the proposals they like. What it does not do is verify if money transactions have factually been made. It does not do the accountancy either. It is a front where collaborative decisions about money can be made transparently. The factual handling of the transactions and accounting have to be done elsewhere.\n\n[https://cobudget.co/](https://cobudget.co/)\n\n ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pCktwuaYUi5c5jBDz6u0B6L9RvjxpeeKiJ7-R9srUk0ADq07PjTNs9WYTOYwaIPDDDdUV8cwq12-KYv_q8WniMr6VaO6DEAOT4CnHOfGytDSlrTukv5ZLUCJ0hGgeNzHYkq6TwI_gHPPpQG--rlNM2807D7nZLxIjzF98z0EBVeT6oGM60NpcZuSmF0g)\n\n### [Backfeed](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\nBackfeed attended the OuiShare summit in 2015 starting up a project together with OuiShare to create the first blockchain based experiment of open value accounting in which each and everyone’s needs and contributions are met with adequate rewarding out of existing budgets. An important new development was the measuring of ‘reputation’ as well as ‘value’ in the form of tokens, which led to jokes about ‘now I will lose all of my reputation’ and the like.\n\n\nUntil 2016:\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/](http://backfeed.cc/)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/TechnicalSummary.pdf)\n\n[http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf](http://backfeed.cc/assets/docs/BackfeedEconomicModel.pdf)\n\n[http://github.com/Backfeed](http://github.com/Backfeed)\n\n\nExperiment in OuiShare in 2016:\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1](https://www.ouishare.net/article/decentralizing-part-of-ouishare-with-blockchain-experiment-1)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2](https://www.ouishare.net/article/how-to-slowly-lose-control-decentralization-experiment-2)\n\n[https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3](https://www.ouishare.net/article/between-friction-and-seamlessness-ouishare-decentralization-experiment-chapter-3)\n\n\nUpdates and articles:\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society](https://www.coindesk.com/primavera-de-filippi-blockchain-quest-decentralize-society)\n\n[http://magazine.backfeed.cc/](http://magazine.backfeed.cc/)\n\n\nGeneral notes on the meaning of blockchain and decentralization of OuiShare Fest 2016: \n\n[https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain](https://library.ouishare.net/ouishare-fest-paris-2016-documentation/the-program-tracks/decentralization-and-blockchain)\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OPm49wqSN3bH6JtGsx4csyBdqYIgRenuQIB5-7bNksgh_T8_gvKplgPnCBxVlZSfu2axhqYaBwCzJ6PhpfefVyBpwzg3qNrLjt9hBdC0SWz2GDfMFzQyG0s-m1TNShCJlKu250Yc8oxv6Kg5MzyROyTOKm6oGj0LZIYSj9KRdHNTTXyeFxbu_i9N_vxW)\n\n### [Daostack](https://daostack.io/) \n\nBackfeed has been stopped as a project and went into a next initiative: Daostack.\n\n[https://daostack.io/](https://daostack.io/)\n\n[https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf](https://daostack.io/wp/DAOstack-White-Paper-en.pdf)\n\n[https://github.com/daostack](https://github.com/daostack)\n\n\nRelation with Backfeed:\n\n[https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29](https://daotalk.org/t/relationship-between-daostack-and-backfeed/29)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-and-previous-projects-3ba3c0b69fd1)\n\n\nDaostack articles:\n\n[https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/better-organize-decentralize-matan-field-daostack/)\n\n[https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/](https://cryptovest.com/reviews/daostack-ico-review-aiming-to-usher-in-an-era-of-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/)\n\n[https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-in-2019-76d7634e27c6)\n\n\nA synthesis of the answer provided by DAOstack’s architect Matan Field is that with Backfeed he had taken too much on himself as at some point he was effective the CEO, CTO, chief scientist, and chief product. Besides, in his words, the project lacked focus overall. Due to the many questions regarding function and design of decentralized collaborative platforms, during 18 months of work, Backfeed circled through 5 different products in search of the ultimate one that would materialize the vision and bring it into reality. Thus, it became clear that the team should stop and really specify the product it needs/wants to develop, before jumping again into further development.\n\nPayment and collaboration are currently being implemented through Genesis Alpha as a series of steps in the Alchemy project: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/news/workers-ditching-gig-economy-4398467/)\n\n\n“With Alchemy, hundreds, thousands, and perhaps someday, millions of people will be able to contribute to an efficient decision-making process for allocating funds.”\n\n\n“Alchemy offers a user-friendly interface from which thousands of people (or more) can coordinate towards a common purpose. Our plan to achieve this is by starting to “[Dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)” Alchemy ourselves and use it as the main interface to manage several pilots that will safely lead up to the creation of the Genesis DAO. Another path we are taking in achieving this goal is to release a set of features that will enable any group in the world to safely and easily create and manage their own DAO.

Each contributor evaluates how much value (as opposed to time or effort) each person’s contribution played in the final result.

This is a widespread and complex problem.  Yet, without making [[BestEfforts]] in an attempt to provide solutions for some people at least, no means to define a solution will be produced.  In this case, there is a broader ecosystem framework that is thought to provide a scaffolding framework to support the development of solutions to this, and many other problems.  However, as these works need to be done; and that there isn't possibly the means to find and structure,\n1. The means to formerally engage in a manner akin to contract and/or employment agreements all persons who may be able to contribute usefully in some way big or small; and that,\n2. the means to find all the money needed to pay everyone for work that they may or may not do well is not practically feasible; and that,\n3.

The licensing context (ie: exclusively provided?  or provided, and able to be used by other projects)\n5.

The Context in which the work was either funded or sought to be subject to compensatory terms based upon the usefulness and/or successful employment of the works derivatives.\n\nThere are others; and this area is to be explored in a more fulsome way as the documentation develops.  \n\n### Australian Context\nWebCivics is currently being produced from Australia.

Network tariffs can be based on a variety of factors, including the amount of data or bandwidth used, the length of time the network or service is accessed, or the type of service or application being used.*\n\n*Network tariffs are commonly used by telecommunications companies to charge customers for the use of their mobile phone or internet services. They can also be used by other types of businesses or organizations, such as utilities or transportation companies, to charge customers for the use of their networks or services. Network tariffs are typically structured as a flat fee or as a pay-per-use model, depending on the specific needs of the business or organization.*\n\nNOTE: the considerations about Network Tarrif associates in-turn also to [[Non-FinancialCurrencies]] and in-particular, working on solutions to address biosphere economics issues.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\nMany of these sorts of payments will apply in different ways and different circumstances, as to create various types of financial models for various purposes that will often become linked together via [[SemWebOntologies]] for generating different kinds of functionally useful insights and documents.  \n\nTherein; the ability for a person to perform work activities, whether it be in the form of [[KnowledgeWork]] or [[LabourWork]] requires a person to make an array of payments for things like utilities, rent or mortgages, etc.   This may in-turn be used privately by that person to undertake cost/benefit analysis and other financial management processes; without necessarily sharing that information with others in any way that may be deemed unnecessary.\n\nEqually, depending on the context - some of this information is extremely helpful; for example, for the purpose of seeking a loan or similar where a persons financial position needs to be communicated to the organisation that may in-turn be prepared to offer that loan.  \n\nSimilarly, yet different; in the case of disputes and any circumstances that may in-turn cause a person to suffer losses and/or become unable to service any existing loans; then this information becomes useful to evaluate the costs associated with any dispute and/or insurance related event.\n\nOther forms of payments are critical components that require the appropriate supporting infrastructure, in-order to facilitate those sorts of payment systems with Webizen solutions.\n\nThis is likely to require some sort of payment processing facilitator and support for whatever requirements they may have in-order to provide those services in connection to the use of payments in association with the [[WorkProject]] and/or other applications and related Economic functionality.   \n\nSome investigation needs to be undertaken to comprehend the requirements for supporting economic systems that support micropayments to in-turn compensate [[KnowledgeWork]] and act to [[EndingDigitalSlavery]] as is in-effect part of the broader [[FairWorkProtocols]]. \n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/WorkProject/Currencies/GiftsAndDonations/","title":"Gifts and Donations"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Gifts and Donations\n\n***Content Generated by ChatGPT***\n\nGifts and donations are types of payments that are made without the expectation of receiving anything in return.

The Response was as follows,\n\nCarbon credits are a type of non-financial currency that can be bought and sold as a way to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon credits are used as a way to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to promote the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nUnder a carbon credit system, a government or other authority sets a cap on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted within a specific region or sector. Companies or other organizations that exceed their allocated carbon emissions are required to purchase carbon credits from those that have emitted less than their allocated amount. This creates a market for carbon credits, with the goal of reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions and incentivizing the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\nCarbon credits can be bought and sold on carbon markets, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) or the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). The value of carbon credits is typically based on the cost of reducing or offsetting a ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nOverall, carbon credits are a way to use market forces to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the adoption of clean energy technologies.\n\n\n\n>Then, i asked,\n> Q: What are some other non-financial biosphere related currencies?\n\nThere are many types of non-financial currencies that are related to the biosphere or the natural environment.

Fungible goods or assets are interchangeable, meaning that they can be used to satisfy a debt or obligation regardless of their specific characteristics or qualities.\n\n*For example, money is a fungible asset because it can be exchanged for any other good or service of equal value. Gold is also a fungible asset because it can be traded for other gold or for other goods or services of equal value. In contrast, non-fungible goods or assets are unique and cannot be exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. For example, a work of art or a collectible item is non-fungible because it has a unique value that cannot be replicated or replaced.*\n\n*Another term for fungibility is exchangeability. When a good or asset is exchangeable, it means that it can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value. Exchangeability is closely related to the concept of fungibility, and the two terms are often used interchangeably to refer to the property of goods or assets that can be traded or exchanged for other goods or assets of equal value.*\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/old_notes/AgentLabelling/ArtificialMinds/TheArtificialMindsIndex/Baymax/","title":"Baymax"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"_**Big Hero 6**_ is a 2014 American [computer-animated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation \"Computer animation\") [superhero film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film \"Superhero film\") produced by [Walt Disney Animation Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios \"Walt Disney Animation Studios\") and released by [Walt Disney Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures \"Walt Disney Pictures\").
