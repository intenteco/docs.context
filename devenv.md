# Dev Environment

ATM - plan is to use Virtuoso.  Download [Openlink Virtuoso Opensource](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource) and install.

Server Side plan is to target the initial build to be [Solid Compatible](https://solidproject.org/), therefore find a [Solid Pod](https://solidproject.org/users/get-a-pod) or deploy one yourself (instructions / links TBD)

Development Environment used is VSCODE.

The WebExtension is targeting [Mozilla FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and support for other browsers to be investigated once this initial implementation is done.

The UI Toolkits used presently, are not opensource.  As such, the project cannot be made available fully as open-source, rather, it must be distributed as a product.
