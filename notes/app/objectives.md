# Project Objectives

1. Baked into browser

The app output should be part of the users web-experience, baked into the browser.

2. socialfactors
The social factors are the most important issues to address, indeed, its the purpose of the project.  this document may not be complete, but is defined as a seperate document to support the growth of those topics, which is in-turn associated with other notes in the `/socialfactors` directory.

3. interoperable modes
The objective target is to support knowledge work activities via the browser.  However, without support for individuals as human persons in their own private capacity, the ability to ensure support for human rights via work related practices, is mute.  However, there is not a clear distinction between work and personal, in these environments.  

People don't go to work and its entirely seperate from a persons personal life, its time and activity based.

The 'social graph' is also blended... and requires significant improvement.

4. Spatio-Temporal not 'data-centric' state-static. 

There's complex informatics involved in time - place/space relations.  

5. Local Agent
There's a question about whether and/or how the computational capacities can be best achieved, either in the browser, or connected to the browser, with a local runtime that's running in the tray - supported by the browser plugin.

6. IdP via Domain Name

The primary public IdP is a users domain name, however the objective is that the must own the TLD.  Problem with this is that some domains, might be sub-domais of others tlds..  Tricky DNS stuff,nonetheless, point is, not facebook or whatever. at least, not for now... 

maybe github / gitpages, idk.  prefer not.
