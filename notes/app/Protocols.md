## Solid

The primary target is solid as a data-store, if this continues to make sense. 

## Other

## gun.eco

Gun.eco is decentralised, runs over webrtc. It has an encryption method called SEA.


## GIT

A Git library has been added. The thinking is that GIT has version control. people know what GIT is, so i'll not describe it further. 

## WebTorrent
