# User Interface Toolkits

## NOTE
Ideally, whatever is employed provides permissive licensing so that this package can be freely distributed on an open-source licensing that is compatible with the W3C Community Contributions License. 

However, this may not be possible.  Some UI Toolkits are purchased.

Part of the hope with this project, is that UI Tool-kit producers, can produce apps that are compatible with the system, without producing a back-end.  however, safety protocols are needed to achieve this outcome.


## OLD EXAMPLES

An old example (2015) for social is: http://dev.webcivics.org/  use dummy data on the form. 

An old exmaple for work stuff-  that is incomplete - is https://webcivics.github.io/CooperativeProjects/
