# Personal Ontology

The concept of personal ontology is being modelled based upon the 'human centric', psychological considerations - relating to consciousness and the status of the observer, which is then to be modelled technologically in a supportive manner.  This has various design implications, and is foundationally important to address in-order to form a methodology to address the social factors and related issues / design requirements..

In the field of knowledge management and semantic web, the term "ontology" typically refers to a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. It's used to reason about entities within that domain and can be used to describe the domain in a formal way.

A "personal ontology" refers to a similar concept, but it is tailored to an individual's specific knowledge, experiences, and understanding of the world. This includes their personal categorizations, relationships, and interpretations of concepts and ideas.

For example, a medical doctor and a software engineer might have very different personal ontologies about the concept of "Java". The doctor might associate "Java" primarily with the Indonesian island or a type of coffee, while the engineer would more likely think of it as a programming language. These differences in interpretation and understanding are reflective of their personal ontologies.

Personal ontologies are subject to change and evolution as individuals acquire new knowledge, experiences, and alter their perspectives.

The idea of personal ontologies has been discussed in various areas, including personalized search, personal knowledge management, and user profiling in the context of semantic web technologies. By understanding a person's ontology, a system can potentially provide more tailored, relevant and personalized results or recommendations.

In the social sciences and consciousness studies, the term "personal ontology" often refers to the set of beliefs, assumptions, and conceptual frameworks that an individual uses to understand, interpret, and interact with the world. It pertains to the questions related to existence, reality, and the nature of being that influence a person's perception of themselves and their surroundings.

Personal ontology, in these contexts, can include assumptions about the nature of reality (e.g., what exists, what doesn't), about knowledge (e.g., what can be known, how it can be known), and about values (e.g., what is good, what is bad). These beliefs influence the individual's thoughts, actions, and interpretations of experiences.

For example, one person might have a personal ontology that includes the belief in the existence of a higher power or spiritual realms, which would affect their perception and understanding of the world in a certain way. Another person might have a personal ontology that is strictly materialistic or atheistic, which would lead to a different interpretation of life events.

Understanding a person's ontology can be crucial in fields like psychology, where therapeutic approaches often involve exploring and challenging a person's ontological assumptions. It is also of relevance in areas like cultural studies, where different groups or societies may have contrasting ontological assumptions leading to different worldviews.

## Facts
Need to define 'facts'

### Values Credentials

Values Credentials need to define 'facts' associated to the statements made by a machine readable / processable document.  Values credentials are employed to define the terms of relationships.

## Modals

Useful if a person could self-check their compliance and level of support for their own personal ontology 'hygiene', but probably not something that is usefully published...  idk..
