# Groups Logic
An individuals choices must be defined to support self-determination. The challenge is in how to provide an easy way for people to make decisions; and then manage them.  

A group - is not necessarily defined by a person who establishes something first and/or organisational structure, although some may.  Not everyone involved in a form of definable group, need interact with one-another.  The rules defined should by default apply to the person as much as they do others. 

This might be able to be turned-off, but then there should be a notification or something to denote it.
