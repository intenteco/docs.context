# Work Activity Considerations

There's various factors associated with work activities that need to be addressed, including support for law.

Whilst social circumstances may provide the means for a person to simply - not have anything to do with someone who has acted to harm them, this is not the case with work activities - at least, not so easily.

Historically, the ability to attack people for gainful benefit - has been supported in, particular ways.

This project seeks to address those issues... via means, that employs - lawful considerations, specifically.
