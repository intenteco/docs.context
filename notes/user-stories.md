# User-Stories

This is about creating a list of user-stories...

## Basic

- [ ] self
    - [ ] Date Of Birth (Enumerate Age)
    - [ ] Place Of Birth
    - [ ] Language
        - [ ] Primary
        - [ ] Other - define, context, competency, rules.
    - [ ] Location 
    - [ ] Personal
            - [ ] (home) Local Choice of Law, rules.
    - [ ] Identity Instruments.

## Personhood
- [ ] Credential Instruments.
- [ ] Identifiers (ie: domains,social networks,etc).
- [ ] Professional
    - [ ] work / employer - choice of law, rules.

### Social

The social network concepts of calling everyone 'connections' or 'friends' is malformed.  This needs to change, but i'm not sure of the language - the method is a bit more - sophistocated, and requires namonclature to better support the implications.  

- [ ] Profiles, user can have persona relating to how they want to curate their environment at that time.  There can be made, but the underlying 'soul' is in-effect - integrated.  The difference, seeks to create space for different 'mindsets', to - associatively (not disassocaitively) provide assistance for people needing to organise their lives in different ways. 

EXAMPLE; 'work', 'home', 'study', 'director of xyz', 'old skool mates', 'yacht-club', etc... 

People may segment how they define their social environments based upon these different persona / rules, but underneath the personas, they're still dealing with the same person.  Therein, people might have different roles, names, etc. but its still all integrated - if someone is - ultimately - blocked - it applies to all 'personalities'. 

### Other top-level categories
- [ ] public, discoverable, rules - rules define whether or not people are discoverable.
- [ ] public, follow, rules - the ability to follow someone elses activities, as a semantic distinction and/or service (ie: RSS)
- [ ] public, comment / interact, rules - the ability to interact with a 3rd party who is otherwise not at all connected in any way.
- [ ] introduction - contacts 'unknown' to each-other otherwise - the ability to 'reach out' to create a formal connection, rules.
- [ ] invitation - contacts have some prior relation - same as 'introduction' but the difference is whether there's some reason why they might know of each-other in some way previously - thereafter seeking to create the semantic connection and related sharing, rules.
- [ ] curator - The curator, is effectively the semantic agent that defines how the informatics between connections - works.

### Social Dynamics
Once people are 'connected' (ie: mutual 'foaf' entries, in-effect, although connected to the values credentials / agreements), then the relationship framework - is - dynamic.  There's no strict classification for any relationship, other than how they're defined semantically between the parties.

- [ ] prior 'connection' contact - so, people meet one-other, form relationships, those relationships grow, flourish, and then sometimes wither and die, sometimes violently - or in ways, that means there's absolutely no contact...  for a period of time, or sometimes - forever... 

situations are all sorts of different.

So - the methodologies need to consider that the means to manage content - legally (not by seeking pervasive controls / external = well, stuff that's unwanted); the theory is, that the agreements in place, continue to stand for the period of time in which they were in-place, and are therefore also supported technically, in-terms of semantics.  If people no-longer want to have anything to do with one-another, save exceptional circumstances (which is a use-case that needs to be supported) then the content generated during their relationship is still available to each-other, on the terms defined at that time.  breach of those terms, may result in enforcable actions - but - generally, the desire is to keep the content in the system, rather than people storing the content elsewhere, that doesnt have any meaningful relationship to rules at all... 

Therefore, when the relationship changes; so does too, the manner in which content is shared between parties.

- [ ] arbritration - the ability to block, via network (ie: due  to abuse, court-outcome, etc.)
- [ ] reunification - if people have a dispute and temporarily become disconnected
    - [ ] data from former relationship
    - [ ] data from period of isolation

## Advanced

### Logic Engine
- [ ] defining the rules
- [ ] query process for the rules
- [ ] data-process involving rules...

### Prolog / Julia

Prolog uses semantic web, but julia can do cuda processing  (weights, essentially??) also seemingly better for spatio-temporal stuff, but idk. experiment.

This in-turn appears to need to be wrapped in rust.
